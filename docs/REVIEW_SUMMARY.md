# DocX Project Review Summary

## Accomplished Tasks

### 1. Purpose Clarification ✓
- Redefined project as a **semantic knowledge graph extractor**
- Shifted focus from text extraction to semantic understanding
- Positioned memory graph as core functionality, not optional feature

### 2. Documentation Updates ✓
- **README.md**: Completely rewritten to emphasize semantic graph extraction
- **architecture.md**: Updated to show memory graph as central component
- **CLAUDE.md**: Revised to guide development toward semantic understanding

### 3. Repository Cleanup ✓
- Removed large test output directories (output_v2/)
- Deleted legacy files:
  - `extractors/ai_transcription.py`
  - `scripts/docaitool_wrapper.sh`
  - `scripts/setup_config.sh`
- Cleaned up egg-info directories and test databases

### 4. Code Analysis ✓
- Identified monolithic files:
  - `cli/commands.py` (929 lines)
  - `core/pipeline.py` (474 lines)
- Found processor naming conflicts:
  - Multiple `DocumentProcessor` classes
  - Unclear processor hierarchy

### 5. Refactoring Plan ✓
- Created detailed plan in `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
- Proposed modular CLI structure
- Defined clear processor hierarchy
- Outlined implementation phases

## Key Changes Made

### Documentation
1. Repositioned project as semantic understanding tool
2. Added knowledge graph examples and use cases
3. Emphasized MCP compatibility
4. Updated configuration to prioritize semantic features

### Code Organization
1. Removed ~500MB of test outputs
2. Eliminated legacy code files
3. Identified architectural improvements needed

### Future Direction
1. Clear path for breaking up monoliths
2. Defined semantic-focused architecture
3. Established processor naming conventions
4. Created testing strategy for semantic features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement CLI refactoring (Phase 3)
2. **Short-term**: Clarify processor hierarchy (Phase 4)
3. **Medium-term**: Consolidate intelligence backends (Phase 5)
4. **Long-term**: Enhance memory module capabilities (Phase 6)

## Impact

The project now has:
- Clear semantic focus
- Cleaner repository structure
- Updated documentation reflecting true purpose
- Actionable plan for code improvements

The refocusing positions DocX as a unique tool for building queryable knowledge graphs from documents, rather than just another PDF converter.
