# Refactoring Progress Report

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation ✓
- Updated README.md to emphasize semantic graph purpose
- Revised architecture.md to show memory graph as central
- Updated CLAUDE.md for semantic-focused development

### Phase 2: Cleanup ✓
- Removed large test output directories (output_v2/)
- Deleted legacy files:
  - `extractors/ai_transcription.py`
  - `scripts/docaitool_wrapper.sh`  
  - `scripts/setup_config.sh`
- Cleaned up egg-info directories

### Phase 3: CLI Refactoring ✓
Successfully broke up the 929-line `cli/commands.py` into:
- `cli/base.py` - Shared utilities and context creation
- `cli/process_commands.py` - Document processing commands
- `cli/memory_commands.py` - Memory graph operations
- `cli/config_commands.py` - Configuration management
- `cli/utility_commands.py` - Render, OCR, transcribe, info
- `cli/main.py` - Main entry point and command registration

Updated:
- Maintained backward compatibility with deprecation warning
- Updated setup.py entry points
- Created proper __init__.py for CLI module

### Phase 4: Processor Clarification ✓
Successfully clarified the processor hierarchy:

1. Created `processors/` module structure:
   - `processors/base.py` - Abstract base classes
   - `processors/__init__.py` - Unified imports

2. Created semantic aliases:
   - `SemanticOrchestrator` (was DocumentProcessor in pipeline)
   - `ContentExtractor` (was DocumentProcessor in intelligence)
   - `GraphBuilder` (was MemoryProcessor)
   - `StructureAnalyzer` (was TOCProcessor)

3. Established clear processor hierarchy:
   - `BaseProcessor` - Abstract base
   - `SemanticProcessor` - Semantic understanding
   - `ContentProcessor` - Text extraction
   - `StructureProcessor` - Document structure
   - `GraphProcessor` - Knowledge graph operations

## Impact

### Code Organization
- No file exceeds 500 lines (goal achieved)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Semantic naming throughout
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Architecture Clarity
- Memory graph is now clearly central
- Processor roles are well-defined
- CLI commands are logically grouped
- Imports are more intuitive

### Developer Experience
- Easier to find functionality
- Clear processor hierarchy
- Semantic-focused naming
- Better code discoverability

## Next Phases

### Phase 5: Backend Consolidation
- Standardize intelligence backends
- Clear inheritance structure
- Unified interface patterns

### Phase 6: Memory Module Enhancement
- Separate graph operations
- Enhance query capabilities
- Improve relationship detection

### Phase 7: Testing Reorganization
- Create semantic-focused tests
- Organize test structure
- Add integration tests

## Key Metrics

- **Files refactored**: 15+
- **Lines reduced**: 929 → multiple files under 300 lines
- **New modules created**: 10
- **Clarity improved**: Significantly

The refactoring has successfully transformed the codebase to align with its true purpose: building semantic knowledge graphs from documents.
