LOUISIANA

betting in 55 of Louisiana’s 64 parishes in January.

Louisiana offers commercial casino gaming at 14 riverboat casinos and one

land-based casino, each of which operates electronic gaming devices and table

games. Four racinos—Ilimited to offering electronic gaming devices—are also
operational. All 19 properties are regulated by the Louisiana Gaming Control
Board (LGCB).

Commercial casino gaming was first authorized in 1991 when the Louisiana
legislature passed a law allowing a maximum of 15 riverboat casinos, either
sailing or permanently moored on specific waterways in different areas of the
state. The following year, legislation passed authorizing a single land-based
casino in downtown New Orleans. Racinos were approved by the legislature in
1997.

In 2020, voters in 55 of 64 Louisiana parishes approved a referendum on
sports betting. Legislation to implement that referendum was then passed
in 2021. Land-based sports betting was launched in Louisiana commercial
casinos and racinos in October 2021, with online sportsbook operations
launching in January 2022.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.59 billion,
up 8.9 percent versus the previous year and reflecting the first full-year with
legal sports betting in Louisiana.
