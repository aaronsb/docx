Top 20 US Commercial Casino Markets

In 2022, 14 of the top 20 commercial casino gaming
markets posted revenue growth compared to the previous
year. The Las Vegas Strip and Black Hawk/Central City
region in Colorado had significant gains year-over-year,
while the southern markets of Tunica/Lula and Shreveport/
Bossier City were impacted by increased competition from
casinos in nearby states and reported notable declines in
annual revenue.

The Las Vegas Strip remained by far the largest casino
gaming market in the country in 2022. The Strip saw

fewer visitors in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic years,
but those who did go spent more on gaming entertainment
per visit than in the past. Elsewhere, the Baltimore-
Washington D.C. market reclaimed its position as the third
largest commercial casino gaming market in the country in
2022, with the MGM National Harbor resort just beyond
Washington D.C. city limits in Maryland generating more
gaming revenue than any commercial casino outside of
Nevada during the year.
