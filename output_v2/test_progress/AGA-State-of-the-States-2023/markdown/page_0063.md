Market Performance

In 2022, total statewide commercial gaming revenue was
$1.13 billion. The record total represented an increase of
10.9 percent from the previous year.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was
$745.7 million, up 7.9 percent versus 2021. Table game
revenue was $386.2 million, up 17.1 percent.

Encore Boston Harbor continued its emergence as one

of the most lucrative commercial casino-resorts in North
America. The property in Everett, just north of Boston,
reported total gaming revenue of $729.7 million, an
increase of 15.0 percent on the prior year. That was
enough to make Encore Boston Harbor the third highest
grossing commercial casino outside of Nevada, behind only
MGM National Harbor in Maryland and Resorts World New
York in Queens.

MGM Springfield reported total revenue of $259.1 million,
up 4.9 percent against 2021, while Plainridge Park Casino
reported revenue of $143.1 million, up 2.7 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution

When Massachusetts authorized commercial casino
gaming in 2011 it established different tax rates for its
Category 1 and Category 2 licensees.

Following the opening of its two full casino-resorts since
2017, Massachusetts has quickly surpassed both Maine
and Rhode Island to become the most lucrative commercial
gaming market in the New England region.

Whereas Plainridge Park, which holds the Category 2
license, is subject to a 49 percent tax on electronic gaming
device revenue, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor
are subject to a lower rate of 25 percent of both electronic
gaming device and table game revenue. The lower overall
rate reflects, in part, the greater staff cost involved in the
hosting of live table games, as well as the larger amounts
Category 1 licensees were required to invest to develop
their casino-resorts. In addition to the taxes on revenue, all
commercial casino facilities must pay a $600 annual fee for
each of their electronic gaming devices.

In 2022, Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos
generated total gaming tax revenue of $317.3 million, up
9.9 percent from 2021.

Of this amount, approximately $107 million was
distributed to Massachusetts’ Gaming Local Aid Fund,
which was created under the 2011 gaming law to help
support the budgetary needs of city and town governments
across the state.

While the Gaming Local Aid Fund receives the largest slice
of casino-resort tax revenue, other major beneficiaries
include transportation and infrastructure projects, K-12
and higher education programs, and a statewide economic
development fund.

Finally, 18 percent of gaming tax revenue generated by
Plainridge Park is directed toward the Massachusetts horse
racing industry.

Competitive Landscape

Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos operate in

a fiercely competitive New England gaming market

that includes several large-scale commercial and tribal
casinos in neighboring Connecticut and Rhode Island that
have traditionally drawn a significant proportion of their
customers from the Bay State.

Additional in-state competition is also pending in the
shape of the Mashpee Wampanoag’s potential tribal
casino-resort on Indian lands in the city of Taunton,
some 20 miles from Plainridge Park Casino. A second
Massachusetts Indian tribe, the Wampanoag Tribe of
Gay Head (Aquinnah), is also developing a more modest
gaming facility limited to electronic bingo devices on the
island of Martha's Vineyard.

Approval of legislation in both Massachusetts and Maine in
2022 means sports betting is now poised to become legal
in every state in the New England region, with the exception
of Vermont. Before the arrival of legal sports wagering,
Massachusetts residents had the option to place bets in
casinos, land-based sportsbooks or mobile platforms in
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
