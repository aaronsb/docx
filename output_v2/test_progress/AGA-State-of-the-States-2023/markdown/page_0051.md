million from three and a half months of operations. All but
$3.1 million of that total was generated by Kansas’ six
initial mobile sports betting platforms.

Without sports betting, Kansas’ commercial casino gaming
market would have reported a modest decline in revenue
for 2022.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices
was $352.4 million, down 3.1 percent from 2021,
although table game revenue increased by some 23.4
percent to $49.1 million.

While three of Kansas’ four commercial casinos reported
an increase in traditional electronic gaming device and
table game revenue, that was not the case at Kansas Star
Casino, the state’s largest.

The casino, which is located just south of Wichita, has
suffered from expanded competition since the opening of
a new tribal casino in 2021 some 25 miles away to the
north of the city. In 2022, Kansas Star Casino reported
total casino gaming revenue of $159.5 million, down

7.8 percent despite the opening of a sportsbook at the
property.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Kansas' commercial casinos are required by statute
to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 27 percent on

2012 to 2022

While three of Kansas’ four commercial casinos reported

an increase in revenue in 2022, the state’s most lucrative
casino, Kansas Star Casino near Wichita, experienced a
decline in revenue, in part due to expanded competition from
a nearby tribal gaming facility which opened in March 2021.

gaming revenue, which includes a minimum 22 percent
contribution to the state, 3 percent to local governments,
and 2 percent to fund problem gambling treatment.
Casinos’ management contracts also include provisions
allowing for higher tax rates to be applied if revenue
exceeds a certain threshold during a calendar year.

In 2022, Kansas’' commercial casinos generated total tax
revenue from electronic gaming devices and table games
of $108.4 million, down 0.5 percent from the previous
year. Of this total amount, approximately $88.3 million
was received by the state, $12.0 million was allocated to
local governments that host casinos, and $8.0 million was
generated to fund problem gambling services.

Per Kansas law, the state portion of casino gaming tax
revenue is distributed to the state’s Expanded Lottery

Act Revenues Fund. Appropriations from the fund are
determined annually at the direction of the state legislature
but must be allocated to specific causes that include state
debt reduction, covering public employees’ retirement
liabilities, and an initiative to increase the number of
engineering graduates at Kansas universities.

A further $2.1 million in gaming tax revenue was raised
in 2022 from newly launched sports betting operations.
Under Kansas' 2022 sports wagering law, all tax revenue
is deposited into the state’s Sports Wagering Fund and
redistributed for specific purposes, including prosecuting
illegal gambling and incentivizing professional sports
teams to relocate to the state.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to its four commercial casinos, Kansas hosts
seven tribal casinos on Indian reservation lands within the
state. Tribal casinos located in the northeastern corner

of the state compete with Hollywood Casino at Kansas
Speedway located just outside of Kansas City. Hollywood
Casino also competes directly with four casinos on the
Missouri side of the Kansas—Missouri border.

Kansas Crossing Casino in southeastern Kansas competes
with several tribal casinos in northeastern Oklahoma,
while Kansas Star Casino competes directly with a tribal
casino in Sedgwick County, near Wichita. As a result of
legislation passed in 2022, Kansas Star Crossing faces
the prospect of additional future competition in the shape
of electronic gaming devices that may now be sited at a
former greyhound track in Sedgwick County.

In May, Gov. Laura Kelly (D) signed a law to authorize
