The ballot petition was supported by more than 814,000
Florida voters, but needed around 80,000 additional voter
signatures in order to qualify for a statewide referendum. A
separate voter petition to authorize statewide mobile sports
betting via commercial sportsbook operators also failed to
qualify for the ballot.

Regulatory Reform

In March, Florida’s commercial casino gaming industry
entered a new regulatory era when the newly established
Florida Gaming Control Commission held its first official
meeting.

The independent agency, overseen by a four-member
commission, was created through legislation approved by
lawmakers alongside the new Seminole compact in 2021.
Previously, Florida’s commercial racinos were overseen by
a division within the state’s Department of Business and
Professional Regulation.

Among the activities undertaken by the new commission

in 2022 were establishing annual and long-term regulatory
plans, hiring appropriate staff and developing a formal
memorandum of understanding with the Seminole Tribe
regarding the oversight of tribal gaming in Florida.
