Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

Development of a major new casino-resort in Chicago took
several steps forward in 2022.

In May, the Chicago City Council approved a Bally’s
Corporation proposal to build a $1.7 billion casino project
at the site of the printing plant of the Chicago Tribune
newspaper.

That proposal had previously been selected by Mayor Lori
Lightfoot to be Chicago’s chosen casino development
partner after a competitive request-for-proposals process.
Additional city council approval was required in order to
execute a formal host community agreement.

Bally’s submitted a formal casino license application to
the lllinois Gaming Board in August, while the Chicago City
Council granted various zoning approvals for the casino
development in December.

A Chicago casino-resort was arguably the headline act
of Illinois’ sweeping 2019 gaming expansion law. Once
licensed, Bally’s will be permitted to operate up to
4,000 electronic gaming devices and table games at the
Chicago casino location as well as at the city’s two major
international airports.

Sports Betting

In October, the lllinois Gaming Board reopened an
application process to award up to three mobile-only
sports wagering licenses available under the state’s 2019
gaming expansion law. An initial licensing process was
abandoned when the lone qualified applicant to step
forward withdrew due to capital market conditions.

The three mobile sports wagering licenses require an
upfront fee of $20 million and were initially supposed
to coincide with an expansion of online sports betting in
[llinois to include remote registration of player accounts.
That planned competitive landscape shifted during the
pandemic, however, as online betting platforms affiliated
with lllinois casinos and racing facilities were permitted
to offer remote registration on a temporary basis for
public health reasons. Remote registration then became
permanently available in March 2022, when statutory
amendments passed in 2021 went into effect.

Regulatory Reform

In December, the lllinois Gaming Board published a series
of draft amendments to modernize the state’s casino
gaming regulations.

Among other things, the draft regulatory amendments
would require commercial casinos to install metal
detectors to prevent firearms on casino gaming floors.
Casino security requirements would also be updated to
reflect digital surveillance recording.

The updated regulations will take effect once published
in the state register and undergoing lllinois’ formal
rulemaking process.
