Colorado applies a graduated tax to electronic gaming
device and table game revenue, ranging from 0.25 percent
on revenue up to $2 million, to 20 percent on gaming
revenue of more than $13 million.

Sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 10 percent,
applied after limited deductions of free bets and other
bonuses and promotions. Sportsbook operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle. Federal excise payments are
also deductible from revenue subject to the state’s sports
betting tax.

In 2022, Colorado commercial casinos generated $187.7
million in gaming tax revenue, up 16.7 percent compared
to the prior year.

All gaming tax revenues from electronic gaming devices
and table games, including license and application fees,
are placed in the Colorado Limited Gaming Fund. After
deducting around $17.5 million to cover state costs
associated with gaming oversight and regulation of
casinos, the remaining money is distributed according to
the following formula:

e 50 percent to the “state share,” which funds grant
programs that benefit higher education, tourism and
select industries in Colorado

e 28 percent to a fund dedicated to historic
preservation and restoration

e 12 percent to the two counties that host commercial
casinos

e 10 percent to the three historic cities that host
commercial casinos

Tax revenue generated by sports betting, meanwhile, is
placed in the state’s newly established Sports Betting
Fund. In 2021, this amounted to approximately $19.6
million.

After deducting initial amounts to cover the state’s direct
costs of regulating sports wagering, and then setting aside
additional funding for Colorado colleges, local governments
hosting casinos and gambling addiction services, the
majority of remaining sports betting tax revenue is
distributed to a state water preservation fund. Some sports
betting tax revenue is also dedicated to the same historic
preservation fund that receives a portion of gaming tax
revenue generated by traditional casino games.

Competitive Landscape

Commercial casinos face limited competition from two
tribal casinos in the southern part of Colorado. One of the
tribal casinos also offers both retail and statewide online
sports betting pursuant to its tribal gaming compact.

The competitive environment for Colorado’s commercial
casinos is likely to remain stable in the near term, with the
addition of sports betting and removal of maximum wager
limits bolstering the casinos of Black Hawk, Cripple Creek
and Central City.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming

Colorado lawmakers and regulators took several measures
to bolster the state’s responsible gaming framework in
2022.

In June, Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed a bill to create a
responsible gaming grant program overseen by the
Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission as well as
the Behavioral Health Administration within the state’s
Department of Human Services. Under the program, an
initial $2.5 million was made available to fund problem
gambling services and programs across the state through
applications submitted for the review by the two state
agencies. Additional funding for the grant program will be
subject to future appropriations by the state legislature.

Another provision of the bill required the Colorado Division
of Gaming to establish statewide self-exclusion registers
for land-based casino gaming and online sports wagering.

In December, the Limited Gaming Control Commission
then adopted formal regulations to implement statewide
self-exclusion and mandate additional responsible gaming
requirements for casino and sports betting operators.

Among other things, the new regulations will require casino
and sports betting operators to submit an annual strategic
