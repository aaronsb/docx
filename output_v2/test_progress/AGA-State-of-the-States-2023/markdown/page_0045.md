devices and table games at riverboat and land-based
casinos, ranging from 15 percent on gaming revenue of up
to $25 million, to 40 percent on gaming revenue of more
than $600 million.

Riverboat and land-based casinos are also subject to a
supplemental wagering tax, which is capped at a maximum
of 3.5 percent of total gaming revenue.

Racinos are taxed at a rate of 25 percent of revenue up
to $100 million; 30 percent on revenue between $100
million to $200 million; and 35 percent on revenue
exceeding $200 million.

Meanwhile, land-based and online sports betting operated
by casinos, racinos and their affiliated online platforms

is taxed at a headline rate of 9.5 percent of revenue.
Sportsbhook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Indiana saw total commercial casino gaming tax
revenue of approximately $688.3 million, up 5.1 percent
against the previous year.

Pursuant to state law, the majority of gaming tax revenue
is held in Indiana’s General Fund and used for general
state budgetary purposes. Additional allocations are made
to Indiana’s horse racing industry, problem gambling
services, and to local city and county governments, among
other things.

Competitive Landscape

Indiana is set to welcome a 13th commercial casino
property in early 2024, when a land-based casino licensed
in the city of Terre Haute is scheduled to open. The casino
was authorized under a 2019 law that allowed for one
casino license in northwestern Indiana to be relocated

to a location in Vigo County, on the state’s border with
[llinois. Local voters approved a casino in a November
2019 referendum and the Indiana Gaming Commission
eventually awarded a license for the project in late 2021.

Commercial casinos in northern Indiana compete with

one tribal casino in the city of South Bend that offers a
full range of electronic gaming devices, table games and
sports betting, having previously been limited to electronic
bingo games.

Thanks to a 2019 lllinois gaming expansion law,
northwestern Indiana casinos that already compete with
various lllinois casinos located in the Greater Chicago
area face the prospect of several new casinos that will
be located within the City of Chicago, as well as in Cook
County to the city’s south and Waukegan to Chicago’s
north.

Elsewhere, riverboat casinos in southeastern Indiana
compete with a trio of Ohio casinos and racinos serving
the Greater Cincinnati market. Casinos in southeastern
and southern Indiana also face growing competition from
the expansion of historical horse racing devices at racing
venues in Kentucky.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming

In September, the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC)
published an independent report regarding the prospective
authorization of iGaming in the state.

The IGC commissioned the study in February in order to
provide an independent forecast on the potential gaming
revenue and economic impact of a legal iGaming market
in Indiana, as well as various policy questions for state
lawmakers to consider.
