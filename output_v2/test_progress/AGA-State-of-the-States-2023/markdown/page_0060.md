Full-year sports betting revenue amounted to $149.5
million, versus just $3.2 million from a few weeks of
operations in 2021. Despite not launching until the day
before Thanksgiving, mobile sports betting still accounted
for a majority of the annual total. In less than six weeks,
online sportsbooks generated $108.2 million in reported
gross revenue. Retail sportshooks at Maryland casinos
generated approximately $41.2 million in revenue in 2022.

Notably, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County
generated more gaming revenue than any commercial
casino property outside of Nevada in 2022. The casino-
resort, located some 11 miles from downtown Washington
D.C. and a short drive from the populous northern Virginia
suburbs, generated approximately $895.7 million in
combined revenue from electronic gaming devices, table
games and retail sports betting in 2022, up 16.2 percent
from the previous year. Those totals allowed MGM National
Harbor to narrowly surpass the $891.7 million generated
by Resorts World New York in Queens.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Maryland’s commercial casinos pay some of the country’s
highest tax rates on proceeds from electronic gaming
devices—between 40 and 61 percent, depending on the

Table games are taxed at 20 percent. In addition to taxes
on revenue, casinos must pay an annual assessment of
$425 per electronic gaming device and $500 per table
game to help fund responsible gambling programs.

Meanwhile, sports betting revenue is taxed at a headline rate
of 15 percent. Sportsbook operations are also subject to a
0.25 percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Maryland’s commercial casino and sports betting
operations generated total gaming tax revenue of $854.7
million, up 5.0 percent from the previous year.

Of the gaming tax total, approximately $617.1 million
was distributed to Maryland’s Education Trust Fund,
which supports public education and construction of new
schools, including public colleges, throughout the state.
Approximately $108.3 million was distributed in the form
of local impact grants and other contributions to local
governments.

The remaining tax revenue generated by traditional

casino games supported the state’s horse racing industry,
responsible gaming initiatives and minority- or women-
owned businesses. In addition, some $6.1 million in
sports wagering tax revenue was deposited into Maryland’s
State Lottery Fund for the benefit of Baltimore City Public
Schools, veterans programs and sports facilities, among
other beneficiaries.

Competitive Landscape

Maryland’s six commercial casinos operate in a competitive
Mid-Atlantic region that includes properties in Delaware,
eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The state’s three
largest casinos—MGM National Harbor, Live! Casino

and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore—also compete directly
with Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, West Virginia, for
customers in the populous Baltimore-Washington D.C.
metro area.

In terms of sports betting, the MGM, Live! and Horseshoe
casinos also compete with a trio of retail sportsbook
facilities at Washington D.C.’s three major sports stadiums
and arenas. In addition, Maryland’s newly launched mobile
sports betting platforms face a degree of cross-border
competition for customers in the Greater Washington

D.C. area from mobile sportsbooks licensed to operate in
Virginia, as well as from the D.C. Lottery’s mobile platform.
