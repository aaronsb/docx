Gaming Tax Distribution

In accordance with 2018’s state constitutional
amendment, Arkansas commercial casinos are subject to
a graduated tax on their revenue. Casino revenue up to
$150 million is taxed at a rate of 13 percent, while a 20
percent rate is applied to any revenue above that amount.
Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Arkansas casinos and racinos generated
approximately $88.6 million in direct gaming tax revenue,
up 10.0 percent against the prior year.

Under Arkansas’ constitution, 55 percent of casino gaming
tax revenue is allocated to the state’s General Revenue Fund,
from which funds are appropriated each year for education,
public safety and various other purposes. A further 27.5
percent of tax revenue is distributed to the cities and
counties that host casinos, with the remainder used to
supplement race purses at the state’s two racetracks.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to competition among the state’s established
casinos and racinos, Arkansas gaming operators also
compete with various casino properties in neighboring
jurisdictions.

ARKANSAS: COMMERCIAL GAMING REVENUE
2007 to 2022

Although electronic gaming devices remain the most
important overall contributor to Arkansas commercial
casino gaming revenue, the newer offerings of tahle games

and sports betting grew at a faster pace than electronic

gaming devices in 2022.

Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis competes directly
with several casinos in Tunica, Mississippi for patrons from
the Memphis metropolitan area, while several large-scale
tribal casino-resorts located just across Arkansas’ western
border in Oklahoma provide competition to Oaklawn Racing
Casino Resort as well as the pending casino in Pope County.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

Three years after the initial rollout of land-based sports
betting, Arkansas casinos became eligible in 2022 to
accept mobile wagers from patrons across the state.

Amended casino gaming regulations to allow statewide
mobile sports betting—crafted by the Arkansas Racing
Commission in late 2021—were approved by two state
legislative committees in February and became effective in
March. Notably, the new regulations were approved by the
legislature despite vocal objections from leading national
online sports betting operators to unique provisions that
require Arkansas casinos to receive at least 50 percent of
the revenue generated by any third-party platforms—or
“skins”—choosing to operate under their license.

Arkansas’ first mobile sportsbook went live in March and
by the end of the year, each of the state’s three active
commercial casinos and racinos had deployed their own
online sports betting platform.

Expansion

Litigation over Arkansas’ fourth and final commercial
casino license continued in 2022, without a definitive
resolution by the end of the year.

In December, a circuit court judge dismissed for lack of
standing one lawsuit filed by a group seeking to block a
casino altogether in Pope County. However, another lawsuit
filed by the losing applicant for the Pope County license
was scheduled to be heard by a separate judge in early
2023.

The litigation followed the Arkansas Racing Commission’s
decision in late 2022 to award the Pope County license
to a business subsidiary of Oklahoma’s Cherokee Nation.
Gulfside Casino Partnership’s lawsuit claimed that
Cherokee Nation Businesses and an affiliated casino
partner lacked sufficient experience to be awarded the
license for its $225 million casino-resort project.

An initial 2020 decision to award the Pope County casino
license to Gulfside Casino Partnership was successfully
challenged in court by the Cherokee Nation, based on the
fact that Gulfside did not have the requisite support of
local government officials currently in office at the time of
submitting its application.
