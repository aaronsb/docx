The decline came despite expansion of the district’s

sports wagering market to two additional retail sports
betting locations, including the opening in June of a
FanDuel-branded sportsbook at DC United’s Audi Field
soccer stadium. The District of Columbia’s sports betting
operations also faced increased out-of-state competition
from sportsbooks at Maryland land-based casinos,
including at MGM National Harbor barely two miles beyond
city limits. Mobile sports betting was also launched in
Maryland in November.

The District of Columbia is an idiosyncratic market, with

a majority of revenue—around 65 percent—coming from
land-based or on-site sports betting operations, as opposed
to mobile sports wagering. Commercial sports betting
operators reported combined revenue of approximately
$15.0 million in 2022, down 22.1 percent on the prior year.
In contrast, the DC Lottery’s GambetDC program reported
annual revenue of $8.2 million, up 7.6 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Revenue from privately-operated sports betting in the
District of Columbia is taxed at a rate of 10 percent.
Private sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

DC Lottery-operated sports betting is not subject to
taxation per se; instead, the lottery returns all net revenue
after operating expenses to the city’s General Fund.

In 2022, commercial and lottery-operated sports betting
operations generated total tax revenue of approximately
$5.6 million, down 1.8 percent versus the previous year.

Under city law, the first $200,000 in total tax revenue
generated by privately-operated sports betting is dedicated
to problem gambling services in the District of Columbia,
with the remainder split evenly between two city funds
that support early childhood education and community
engagement initiatives. All profits generated by the DC
Lottery are transferred to the District of Columbia’s
General Fund.

Competitive Landscape

Sports betting operators in the District of Columbia face
significant and expanding regional competition.

Retail sportsbook locations in the city compete with
those at Maryland’s land-based casinos, racing facilities
and charitable gaming venues. At least one additional
sportsbook at Maryland sports arenas, including the
Washington Commanders’ home stadium FedEx Field, is
also pending.

Competition in the form of mobile sports betting comes
from sportsbook platforms licensed to operate in Virginia
and—as of November 2022—in Maryland.

Within the city, hundreds of licensed bars and restaurants
are eligible to apply for so-called Class B licenses to
operate on-premises sports betting. Although just two
Class B sportsbooks were open as of the end of 2022,
several additional locations have announced plans to enter
the market.

In addition to sports betting, the District of Columbia
also offers traditional and online lottery games via the
DC Lottery, charitable gaming, and electronic gaming
devices that purport to be based on player skill which are
permitted in bars and other licensed establishments.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In October, four District of Columbia council members
introduced a bill to amend the city’s 2019 sports wagering
act and enable commercial operators to offer mobile sports
betting throughout the district in competition with the DC
Lottery.

Under the bill, additional licenses would be made available
for citywide mobile sports wagering, subject to a $1 million
upfront fee and higher tax rate of 15 percent of revenue.

After being heard in one council committee in December,
however, the bill was not advanced for a vote before city
lawmakers adjourned for the year.

The legislation was filed after a series of oversight hearings
in which council members were critical of the performance
of the DC Lottery’s GambetDC sportsbook product. The
DC Office of Lottery and Gaming also held a series of
roundtable discussions in June to take stakeholder and
public input on potential regulatory changes for privately-
operated sports betting.
