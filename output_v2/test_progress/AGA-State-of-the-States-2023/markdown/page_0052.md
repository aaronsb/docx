The legislation enabled Kansas’ four commercial casinos
to operate land-based sportsbooks in their properties

as well as mobile sports betting via a maximum of three
affiliated mobile platforms—or “skins”. Casinos were
also authorized to partner with up to 50 retail locations,
including professional sports stadiums, to host sports
wagering kiosks in their facilities. A minimum of 20
percent of partnering retail locations must be either
veterans halls or fraternal organizations.

Regulations to implement the sports wagering law were
adopted by the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission
and the Kansas Lottery in August, and both land-based
and online sports betting launched in time for the kickoff
of the new National Football League season in September.

Kansas was one of three states to pass legislation to
authorize sports betting in 2022, along with Maine and
Massachusetts.

Expansion

Alongside sports betting, the legislation signed by Gov.
Kelly in May included additional provisions to allow for
electronic gaming devices based on historical horse races
at the shuttered Wichita Greyhound Park racetrack in
Sedgwick County.

Under the new law, up to 1,000 historical horse racing
devices would be permitted at a reopened racing facility.
As of the end of 2022, litigation related to the machines
and their potential conflict with the casino management
contract signed by Kansas Star Casino in the same region
of the state was ongoing.

A further provision of the sports wagering bill also granted
the KRGC and state attorney general express authority to
investigate and prosecute the operation of illegal gambling
devices across Kansas.
