Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

The expansion of Maryland’s sports betting market was top
of the agenda for state gaming regulators and policymakers
in 2022.

In September, Maryland’s independent Sports Wagering
Application Review Commission opened a competitive
process to award up to 60 mobile sports wagering licenses
and up to 30 additional retail licenses that were authorized
by a 2021 state law. The state’s six commercial casinos
were among 17 named locations that were automatically
entitled to receive a retail sports betting license, subject to
regulatory approval.

The commission’s application criteria included one notable
requirement for all licensees to be at least 5 percent
owned by individuals with a personal net worth of less
than less than $1.8 million. The condition was included
following an evaluation by SWARC as to whether it could
set more specific race- or gender-based selection criteria
in line with a mandate from the state legislature to achieve
diversity in Maryland’s sports betting market. Successful
applicants were also required to submit formal diversity
plans for approval by regulators upon receiving a license.

In November, SWARC awarded 10 initial licenses for
mobile sports betting. Seven of those 10 licensees went

live in late November. Additional license applications
remained pending at the end of the year.

In a separate development related to the rollout of sports
wagering, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed legislation in June
to clarify minimum distance requirements between certain
land-based sports betting locations and to enable off-track
betting locations to operate kiosks offering wagers for both
horse races and non-equine sports, subject to certain
conditions.

Regulatory Reform

In November, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission approved new technical and minimum internal
control standards applicable to commercial casino and
sports betting operators in the state.

Among other things, the amended standards clarified
state anti-money laundering reporting requirements to
ensure that both casinos and sports betting operators
provide a copy of reports to state gaming regulators after
first filing them with the federal government’s Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network. The revised standards also
amended previous provisions related to the geolocation of
sports wagers and lowered the minimum payout threshold
for electronic gaming devices in Maryland casinos from 87
to 85 percent.
