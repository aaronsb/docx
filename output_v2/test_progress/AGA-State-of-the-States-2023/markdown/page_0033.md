Gaming Tax Distribution

Revenue from iGaming in Connecticut is taxed at a rate
of 18 percent, while revenue from online and land-based
sports betting is taxed at 13.75 percent. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, iGaming and sports betting generated total tax
revenue of approximately $55.1 million, a more than five-
fold increase from the previous year.

All tax revenue generated by iGaming and commercial
sports betting is deposited in Connecticut’s General Fund
and then redistributed to various state programs including
education, infrastructural investments, policing and
emergency services in accordance with the state’s annual
budget approved by lawmakers.

Competitive Landscape

Connecticut’s wider gaming market is dominated by the
Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods tribal casino-resorts operated
by the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot sovereign tribal
nations on their reservation lands. The two tribal casino-
resorts, both among the largest in the United States,
opened in the mid-1990s and were expanded in 2021 to
include retail sportsbook operations in accordance with
amendments to the two tribes’ gaming compacts.

SELECTED STATES: COMMERCIAL SPORTSBOOK GGR
2022

While Connecticut remains the only state in New England
with iGaming, regional competition for sports betting is
increasingly fierce. Following approval of a new law in
Massachusetts in 2022, each of Connecticut’s bordering
states has legalized both retail and mobile sports wagering.
Historically, both New York and Massachusetts have been
important feeder markets for tribal gaming in Connecticut.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming

In May, Gov. Ned Lamont (D) signed a bill to legally protect
the anonymity of players registering for self-exclusion from
online sports betting or iGaming in Connecticut.

Under prior state law, participants in the Connecticut
Lottery Corporation’s self-exclusion programs were exempt
from disclosure under the state’s Freedom of Information
Act that generally applies to government agencies. The
new legislation made a technical amendment to extend
those same exemptions to self-excluded players enrolling
via Connecticut’s two tribal nations, their sports betting
and iGaming partners, or the sports wagering partner of
the Connecticut Lottery.

The bill further authorized the Connecticut Lottery
Corporation to accept deposits via prepaid cards bought
from a traditional lottery retailer, in order to fund player
accounts for online keno and lottery draw games.

In 2022, Connecticut reported total commercial sports hetting revenue of $135.5 million, with almost 93 percent of that total
being generated by mobile sports wagering platforms affiliated with the state’s two Native American tribes and the Connecticut

Lottery Corporation.
