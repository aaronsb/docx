The published report projected that Indiana would
generate an estimated $836 million in iGaming revenue
by year three of operation, yielding around $164 million

to $376 million in state tax revenue depending on the tax
rate applied through state legislation. The report further
concluded that evidence from the six states with lawful
internet casino gaming suggested that Indiana’s land-
based commercial casinos would see little, if any, negative
impact in terms of cannibalization of their traditional
gaming revenue.

Legislation to authorize internet casino gaming via
Indiana’s land-based commercial casinos and affiliated
online casino platforms was introduced in the Indiana
House in January but died the following month without
receiving a committee hearing. Supporters of iGaming in
the state legislature said they would reintroduce proposals
for consideration in the 2023 session.
