agencies. Gaming regulatory agencies in each state report
monthly and annual revenue differently and readers should
consult those agencies’ websites for further information.

In general, gaming revenue refers to the amount earned
by commercial casinos after winnings have been paid

out to patrons. Importantly, gaming revenue does not
equate to profits earned by commercial casinos from their
operations. Such revenue is earned before properties pay
for various operating expenses, marketing, and employee
salaries, as well as various taxes and fees, among other
things.

Similarly, gaming tax revenue figures listed in the report
reflect only specific gaming taxes paid by casinos, iGaming
platforms, and commercial sportsbook operations out of
revenue won from patrons. They do not include various
other state, local, and federal taxes that apply to casinos
as they do to most other businesses. They also do not
include the federal excise tax of 0.25 percent generally
applied to sports betting handle across most states, nor
the $50 fee per sportsbook employee that businesses that
pay the excise tax must also pay.

For the purposes of calculating state gaming tax revenue
totals, reported tax figures include taxes directed to state
and local governments and the specific casino gaming
revenue funds established by those entities. They also
include mandatory allocations of gaming revenue from
commercial gaming operations to non-government entities,
such as problem gambling services, race purses, breeding
programs, and other funds used to support local racing
industries.

In certain states, gaming is operated under the authority
of the state government, and a portion of casino revenue
is then redistributed to private operators. Where this is the
case, this report considers the effective tax rate applied

to gaming operators to be the portion of gaming revenue
retained by the state or its designated beneficiaries.

Information on supplier licensing in the table in this report
is limited to those supplier entities that either manufacture
electronic gaming devices or table game equipment or
distribute or otherwise sell them to casinos. In many
states, additional licensing requirements are applicable

to the suppliers of various other goods and services to
casinos. Readers are advised to consult the websites

of state gaming regulatory agencies for more specific
information.
