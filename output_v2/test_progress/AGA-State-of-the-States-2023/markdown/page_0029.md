In 2022, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue

COLORADO

reached a record $1.41 billion as casino operators

reported strong growth in both table game and sports

betting revenue.

Market Overview

Colorado offers commercial casino gaming at 33 facilities in three historic
towns—Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek—which were approved for
gaming by voters in a 1990 statewide referendum. Each of the casinos operates
electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting. The casinos can also
offer online sports betting in accordance with a state law approved by voters in
2019. At the end of 2022, 23 online sports platforms were available.

Commercial casino gaming and sports betting are regulated by the Colorado
Division of Gaming, which is supported by the Colorado Limited Gaming Control
Commission—a five-member regulatory oversight body appointed by the governor.

Market Performance

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue reached $1.41
billion, up 15.1 percent from the prior year.

The record total reflected continued growth of the state’s sports betting market
as well as recent regulatory changes that improved the competitiveness of casino
gaming in the three mountain towns authorized to host land-based casinos.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $903.6 million,

up 4.9 percent from 2021. Revenue from table games was $156.2 million, an
increase of 36.5 percent and partly reflecting a first full year of new regulations
that eliminated a prior $100 maximum bet limit and permitted casinos to offer
baccarat and other table games for the first time.
