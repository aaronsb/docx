MARYLAND

Total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue hit a
record $2.20 billion in 2022, a year that saw the launch
of mobile sports wagering.

Maryland offers commercial casino gaming at five land-based casinos and
one racino, each of which is eligible to operate electronic gaming devices,
table games and sports betting. The casinos are regulated by the Maryland
Lottery and Gaming Control Agency and Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission.

Commercial casino gaming was first approved in 2008 when Maryland voters
passed a constitutional amendment allowing a total of five casinos limited to
electronic gaming devices. The market expanded in 2012 when lawmakers and
voters authorized table games at all casino properties as well as a license for a
sixth commercial casino in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, near Washington D.C.

Sports betting was approved by state voters in 2020 and authorized via a state
law enacted the following year. Land-based sports betting was launched at
Maryland commercial casinos in late 2021, followed by mobile sports betting in
November 2022.

Partly reflecting a first full-year of legal sports betting in Maryland, total
statewide commercial casino gaming revenue reached a record $2.20 billion in
2022, up 14.3 percent versus the prior year.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $1.33 billion, up 2.2
percent relative to 2021, while revenue from table games was $723.4 million,
up 16.1 percent.
