Fueled by the continued growth of lowa’s online sports

betting market, total statewide commercial gaming

revenue reached a record total of $1.93 billion in 2022.

lowa offers commercial casino gaming at 15 land-based casinos, three riverboat
casinos and one racino. The 19 properties, all of which operate electronic
gaming devices, table games and sports betting, are regulated by the lowa
Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC).

In 1989, lowa became the first state to legalize riverboat casinos with the
passage of the Excursion Gambling Boat Act. Electronic gaming devices at
racetracks were authorized in 1994, with table games approved in 2005. A
2019 law allows lowa’s commercial casinos and racinos to offer land-based and
online sports betting. At the conclusion of 2022, sports betting was available at
each of lowa’s 19 commercial casino locations as well as through a total of 18
affiliated mobile sports wagering platforms.

There are no statutory limits on the number of commercial casinos that may
operate in lowa. However, counties seeking to host a casino or racino must
secure the approval of a majority of its residents via a county-wide referendum.
A second voter referendum is required eight years after initial approval.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$1.93 billion, up 3.7 percent versus the previous year.

Revenue from electronic gaming devices was $1.59 billion, up 0.7 percent
versus 2021, while revenue from table games was $178.8 million, up 4.0
percent.
