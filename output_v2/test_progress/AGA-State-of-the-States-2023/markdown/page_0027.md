ARKANSAS

Market Overview

Arkansas offers commercial casino gaming at two racinos and one land-based
casino, each of which operates electronic gaming devices, table games, and
both on-site and mobile sports betting.

In 2018, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to allow casino
gaming at the state’s two racetracks, Oaklawn Park and Southland Park, as

well as at two new facilities located in Jefferson and Pope counties. Prior to the
constitutional amendment, gaming operations at the two tracks were restricted
to electronic gaming devices offering games of skill or games determined by the
outcome of historical horse races. Casino gaming and sports betting is regulated
by the Arkansas Racing Commission.

Market Performance

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$614.1 million, up 8.7 percent versus the prior year.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $533.6 million, up
5.5 percent, while revenue from table games was $62.6 million, up 23.6 percent.

Bolstered by the launch of mobile sports betting, total sports wagering revenue
was $17.9 million, more than double 2021’s total of $8.5 million.
