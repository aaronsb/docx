In 2022, lowa’s commercial casino and sports betting
operations generated total gaming tax revenue of $393.2
million, up 0.6 percent from the prior year.

Of that amount, approximately $362.1 million was
received by the state and reallocated to various
beneficiaries, including the Rebuild lowa Infrastructure
Fund and lowa Skilled Worker & Job Creation Fund. A
further $17.2 million was allocated to city and county
governments that host casinos, while $13.8 million went to
community foundations in counties without casinos.

Competitive Landscape

lowa's commercial casinos compete with four tribal casinos
located within the state’s borders as well as with various
commercial and tribal casinos located in neighboring
South Dakota, Nebraska and Missouri.

Cross-border competition intensified in 2022 with the
opening of Nebraska’s first commercial casino locations,
and forthcoming racinos in Omaha and South Sioux City
are poised to compete directly with lowa casinos in Council
Bluffs and Sioux City, respectively.

Casinos in eastern lowa also face competition from
electronic gaming devices (VGTSs) in lllinois bars and other
retail venues.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

After voters in Linn County passed a second referendum

in November 2021 to grant local approval for a potential

casino in the city of Cedar Rapids, state lawmakers acted
in 2022 to forestall any discussion of a 20th commercial
gaming property in lowa.

In June, Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed a bill preventing
the lowa Racing and Gaming Commission from issuing any
additional casino licenses until at least June 1, 2024. The
moratorium would not apply to an existing casino seeking
to move to a new location within the same county.

The lowa Racing and Gaming Commission twice voted to
deny a new casino in Cedar Rapids in 2014 and 2017,
citing concerns of market saturation. Regulators had
been prepared to revisit the issue in 2022, however, after
receiving new market studies as to the impact of a new
casino on the state’s gaming industry.
