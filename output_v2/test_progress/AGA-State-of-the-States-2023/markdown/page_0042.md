betting market in the U.S. in 2022, as it leapfrogged New
Jersey but both states were eclipsed by New York following
the launch of mobile sports wagering in the Empire State.

Thanks in part to the end of a previous regulatory
requirement for all player accounts to be registered in-
person at a land-based casino or racing facility, online
sports betting revenue increased by more than 52 percent
to $760.3 million. Land-based sports betting revenue was
$33.8 million, up 40.0 percent.

Total statewide revenue from traditional casino gaming was
also up in 2022, reflecting a first full year of electronic
gaming device operations at Illinois’ 11th casino property
in Rockford as well as the temporary suspension of casino
gaming in January 2021 due to the pandemic.

Electronic gaming devices in lllinois casinos generated
revenue of $1.01 billion. That total was up 13.4 percent
against 2021 but still lower than in the years prior to the
pandemic amid ongoing competitive pressures from video
gaming devices in bars and at other retail establishments.
Table game revenue at lllinois commercial casinos was
$338.7 million, up 14.1 percent. lllinois’ 11 commercial
casinos admitted some 9.1 million patrons during 2022,
versus 7.7 million the previous year.

million in gaming tax revenue was generated for local
governments that host casinos, with a further $8.4 million
provided to Cook County from local sports wagering taxes.

Competitive Landscape

The prolonged rollout of a sweeping gaming expansion law
enacted in June 2019 means the competitive landscape for
lllinois’ commercial casino industry remains in a state of flux.

At the end of 2022, only one of at least eight new casino
gaming facilities authorized under that law had begun
operations. That casino—Rockford Casino—was also
open only as a temporary facility, with a full casino-resort
property still under development. New casino properties in
the cities of Chicago, Danville and Waukegan and in Cook
and Williamson counties remain at different stages of the
development and licensing process but all are expected to
open in the coming years. Meanwhile, lllinois’ two active
racetracks have applied for licenses to offer electronic
gaming devices and table games at their facilities, also in
accordance with the 2019 law.

Prior to the 2019 legislation, the primary competitive
challenge to lllinois’ commercial casino gaming industry
had come from the rollout of electronic gaming devices—
or video gaming terminals (VGTs)—in bars, restaurants,
truck stops and other retail establishments, as authorized
under a 2009 state law.

In 2022, lllinois’ network of more than 45,000 VGTs in
some 8,226 establishments generated total revenue of
$2.71 billion, up 9.5 percent versus the prior year.

In addition to the in-state competition, lllinois commercial
casinos in the Greater Chicago and East St. Louis
markets also compete directly with gaming properties in
northwestern Indiana and eastern Missouri, respectively.
