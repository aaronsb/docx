DELAWARE

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming
revenue was $491.8 million, up 1.8 percent from 2021

and the highest revenue total in more than a decade.

Delaware offers commercial casino gaming at three racinos, each of which
operate electronic gaming devices, table games, sports betting and iGaming
under the authority of the Delaware Lottery.

In 1994, the Delaware legislature approved the Horseracing Redevelopment
Act, which authorized racetracks to install electronic gaming devices. Table
games and limited sports betting (parlay wagers on professional football games)
were approved by the legislature in 2009 and 2010, respectively. IGaming was
approved in 2012.

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling ending federal prohibitions on expanded
sports wagering, Delaware racinos in June 2018 expanded their sports betting
operations to include a full range of single-game and proposition wagers on

all sports, not just football. Alongside full sportsbook operations at racinos,
the Delaware Lottery also offers football parlay cards at certain retail outlets,
including liquor and grocery stores.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $491.8 million,
up 1.8 percent versus the prior year and reflecting revenue growth from both
traditional and interactive casino games.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $405.3 million, up
1.8 percent against 2021, while table game revenue was $55.6 million, up 8.1
