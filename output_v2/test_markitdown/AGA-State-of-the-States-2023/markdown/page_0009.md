Consumer Spending Trends

According to AGA survey data, 34 percent of the adult
population or 84 million American adults visited a casino
in 2022, up 6 percentage points from 2020 and 2021 but
still 10 points below the pre-pandemic high in 2019.

Compared to previous years, the average American casino
visitor in 2022 was younger and more interested in gaming
relative to other forms of entertainment. The average age
of a casino patron in 2022 was 42.4 years old, down from
43.6 in 2021 and 49.6 prior to the pandemic in 2019.
Roughly half of casino patrons visited a casino primarily or
mostly to gamble last year, whereas prior to the pandemic
most casino visitors were there primarily or mostly for non-
gaming entertainment.

Growth Through Traditional and
Internet Casino Gaming

Across the 27 states with land-based commercial casinos,
revenue from traditional casino games was a record $47.83
billion in 2022, up 6.4 percent versus the prior year.

Among the 25 states that reported separate revenue
statistics for electronic gaming devices and table games,
revenue from electronic gaming devices grew 5.1 percent
year-over-year to $34.19 billion, while table game revenue
increased 13.9 percent to $10.00 billion. Revenue for both
tables and slot gaming were records for each segment.

Overall, 23 of the 27 states with land-based commercial
casinos reported an increase in revenue from traditional
casino gaming in 2022. The only exceptions were Kansas,
Michigan, Mississippi and South Dakota, with competition
from tribal gaming operations impacting revenue in

the former two states and the latter two facing difficult
annual comparisons after particularly strong revenue
performances in 2021.
