Revenue from traditional electronic gaming devices and
table games at Louisiana casinos and racinos increased by
a modest 0.3 percent to $2.38 billion.

Total statewide sports betting revenue reached $214.5
million, compared with just $10.1 million in revenue

in 2021, though that figure was from fewer than three
months of land-based sportsbook operations. After
launching in mid-January 2022, mobile sports wagering
generated $180.4 million in revenue—or approximately 84
percent of the statewide total.

Growth in the Louisiana casino gaming market was not
spread evenly across all regions of the state. Whereas total
casino revenue increased in the Lake Charles and New
Orleans markets, revenue was down year-over-year in the
Shreveport/Bossier and Baton Rouge regions.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Revenue from each type of commercial casino
establishment in Louisiana—riverboat casinos, racinos
and the New Orleans land-based casino—is subject to a
different tax structure.

Riverboat casinos pay a maximum effective tax rate of
27.5 percent, comprising a state gaming tax of 21.5
percent of revenue plus additional local taxes which vary
according to location.

Racino revenue is taxed at an effective rate of about 36
percent. That rate comprises an 18 percent contribution
to the Louisiana horse racing industry taken off the top,
with the remaining revenue subject to a state tax of 18.5
percent and local taxes of 4 percent.

The New Orleans land-based casino pays the greater of
either a 21.5 percent tax on gaming revenue or an annual
fee of $60 million. The land-based casino must also remit
rent and various other payments to local authorities, as
established under its operating contract.

Meanwhile, sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 10
percent in the case of land-based sports wagering and 15
percent for online sports betting. Sportsbook operations
are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Louisiana’s commercial casino, racino and sports
betting operations generated total gaming tax revenue of
approximately $601.1 million, up 4.9 percent from the
previous year.

In accordance with state law, the majority of gaming

tax revenue is remitted to Louisiana’s General Fund.
From there, finds are appropriated at the direction of the
legislature and used to pay for public education, public
retirement systems, highway construction, and fire and
police protection, among other things.

In addition, the state’s horse racing industry received
approximately $58.3 million in 2022 from taxes on
racinos’ revenue from electronic gaming devices.

Competitive Landscape

Louisiana’s commercial casinos and racinos compete

with five tribal casinos scattered throughout the state
which offer a full range of casino gaming, including sports
betting. There are also nearly 12,200 electronic gaming
devices offered in Louisiana at more than 1,400 non-
casino locations, such as bars, restaurants, truck stops
and off-track betting parlors. In 2022, total statewide
revenue from electronic gaming devices in non-casino
locations was $809.9 million, down 3.5 percent from the
previous year.

Casinos in southeastern Louisiana compete directly with
commercial casinos in the Gulf Coast region of neighboring
Mississippi that have historically drawn a significant
proportion of their patrons from across the border.

Properties in the Lake Charles and Shreveport/Bossier
regions have traditionally competed with tribal casinos
in Oklahoma to attract players from Texas, meaning they
would be vulnerable to losing patrons should lawmakers
in the Lone Star State approve a bill to authorize casino-
resorts during Texas’ 2023 biennial legislative session.
