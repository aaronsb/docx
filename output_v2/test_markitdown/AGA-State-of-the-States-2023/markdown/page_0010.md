Annual Internet Gaming Revenue
2014 to 2022

Internet casinos continued their strong growth in 2022
despite no new states coming online. Combined iGaming
revenue across the six states with lawful online casinos
reached a record total of $5.02 billion, up 35.3 percent
compared to the previous year. New Jersey, Michigan and
Pennsylvania accounted for more than 88 percent of the
nationwide total. Each of the those three states secured
positions in the top five largest regulated internet casino
gaming markets in the world, with annual revenue of $1.66
billion, $1.38 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively. In its
first full year of operation, Connecticut reported iGaming
revenue of $280.7 million.

Despite the impressive revenue growth, however, no
additional states acted to legalize iGaming in 2022,
although legislation was considered by lawmakers in at
least seven states, including Indiana, lllinois and New York.

Annual Sports Betting Revenue
2019 to 2022

Fueled by the launch of mobile sports betting in New York,
the U.S. sports betting market continued to grow during the
fourth full year since 2018’s historic U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that permitted all states to regulate sports wagering.

The regulated U.S. sports betting market generated total
revenue of $7.56 billion in 2022, not including sportsbook
operations in tribal casinos. That total marked an increase
of almost 75 percent on the prior year. The increase in
revenue came as Americans legally bet some $93.73
billion, compared to a handle of $57.53 billion in 2021.

New York accounted for $1.37 billion—or more than 18
percent—of the national revenue total, as the Empire

State’s launch of online sports betting in January saw it
become comfortably the largest legal sports betting market
in the country. lllinois was the nation’s second largest sports
betting market in 2022, while New Jersey fell from first to
third position as the state reported a year-over-year decline
in annual sports wagering revenue, largely reflecting the
expanded competition from its northern neighbor.

By the end of 2022, legal sports betting was available in
32 states plus the District of Columbia. Kansas, Maine and
Massachusetts all passed legislation to authorize sports
betting during the year, with the Kansas market going

live in September just prior to the 2022 football season.
Alongside New York, mobile sports betting was launched in
Louisiana, Arkansas and Maryland.
