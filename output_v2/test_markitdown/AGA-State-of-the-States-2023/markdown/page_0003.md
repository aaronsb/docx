ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the
commercial casino gaming industry in each of the 35
jurisdictions with legal commercial casino gaming or sports
betting as of December 31, 2022.

For each of the jurisdictions, the report analyzes gaming
revenue and gaming taxes generated by commercial casino
locations, as well as sports betting and iGaming platforms,
for the calendar year 2022. In addition, the report provides
an overview of the primary competition faced by the
gaming industry in each state and summarizes the year’s
major gaming policy discussions in each jurisdiction.

Tables at the beginning of this report provide a comparative
summary of the main licensing, taxation, and responsible
gaming requirements applied to casino and sports betting
operators, as well as to suppliers of electronic gaming
devices and table game equipment. This report defines
commercial casino locations as licensed land-based
casinos, riverboat casinos, racetrack casinos (racinos),
and jai alai frontons with gaming operations. It also
includes casino locations in states such as Delaware,

New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island that offer electronic
gaming devices classified as video lottery terminals and
are operated by commercial casinos under the authority of
those states’ lotteries.

For the purposes of identifying commercial casino location
numbers, we do not include certain other types of gaming
locations, such as horse or dog racetracks without
electronic gaming devices, historical horse racing terminal
locations or off-track betting operations, lottery retail
locations, charitable gaming venues, tribal gaming facilities
as defined by the National Indian Gaming Commission,
card rooms or other locations at which gaming is incidental
to the primary business.

State gaming and tax revenue totals do not include revenue
and taxes from these non-commercial casino locations,
with the exception of Nevada. Due to its unique nature,
revenue and tax data from some Nevada locations which
offer “non-restricted” gaming as incidental to their primary
business is included.

Also excluded from state gaming revenue and tax totals is
revenue derived from convenience locations with electronic
gaming devices—such as video lottery terminals or video
gaming terminals—in lllinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and West Virginia.
The competitive impact of each of the above operations,
however, is noted where warranted.

State gaming revenue and tax totals do include iGaming
operations managed by commercial casinos or affiliated
companies in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Nevada,

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The totals
also include all revenue from land-based and online
sports betting in each of the states with legal sports
betting, with the exception of land-based sports betting
revenue earned by tribal casinos. Such totals include
sports betting revenue derived from a handful of non-
casino locations, such as racetracks, sports stadiums,
off-track betting outlets, and standalone sportsbook
locations in Connecticut, Delaware, lllinois, Indiana,
Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C.

Sports betting handle and revenue information is reported
differently across states. In certain states, including
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and
Wyoming, total sports betting revenue reflects the “gross
revenue” reported by sportsbooks prior to deductions to
account for promotional spending or free-bet promotions
extended to players. Further, certain states, including
Nevada, use an accrual method of accounting that
includes only revenue from completed events. Others,
including New Jersey, utilize a cash method of accounting.
Under this accounting, bets made during 2022 on future
events, such as the 2023 Super Bowl or World Series
winner, for example, are included in 2022 revenue and
future monthly revenue reports would be adjusted to
reflect the outcome of those sporting events and whether
operators paid out winnings to customers. Readers should
consult the websites of state regulatory agencies for more
information on how each state accounts for sports betting
revenue. Due to reporting restrictions, commercial casino
gaming revenue does not include revenue derived from
parimutuel betting on horse races at commercial casino
race and sportsbooks, except for such revenue derived at
Nevada commercial casinos.

This report uses the term “electronic gaming device” to
refer to the various types of gaming devices installed in
casinos, commonly known as “slot machines.” Although
the general public may not differentiate between the
various types of electronic gaming devices, there are
often important regulatory and technological distinctions
between them and specific legal definitions are applied to
different categories of devices in different states. State-
specific terminology for electronic gaming devices includes
video lottery terminals (VLTs), video gaming terminals
(VGTs), video poker, and electronic gaming machines,
among others.

All references to “gaming revenue” are used as a
substitute for more specific financial terms—including
“casino win,” “adjusted gross receipts,” “gross gaming
revenue” and others—as reported by state regulatory
