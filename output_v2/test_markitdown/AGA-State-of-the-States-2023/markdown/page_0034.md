DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA

The District of Columbia reported a 13.4 percent
decline in sports betting revenue to $23.2 million in
2022, the first full year of legal sports wagering in

neighboring states Maryland and Virginia.

Market Overview

The District of Columbia has no commercial casino venues but offers private-
and lottery-operated sports wagering at five retail sportsbooks and via three
mobile platforms.

The city authorized sports betting in 2019 when the D.C. Council passed a

law authorizing the DC Lottery to directly operate sports wagering via licensed
retailers and through a mobile platform available in all parts of the city, with the
exception of federal lands.

The law also authorized Washington D.C.’s four major sports arenas to host a
retail sportsbook operation and offer limited mobile wagering within a two-block
radius of their facilities. Finally, bars and restaurants licensed to serve alcohol
in the District of Columbia are eligible to apply for licenses to offer on-site
sports betting strictly within their premises.

In addition to directly operating sports wagering, the DC Lottery regulates
privately-operated sports betting operations via the city’s Office of Lottery and
Gaming (OLG).

Market Performance

In 2022, total sports betting revenue in the District of Columbia amounted to
$23.2 million, down 13.4 percent on the previous year.
