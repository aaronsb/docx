a sports betting bill in 2020, citing concerns over a
proliferation of advertising and a desire for further study of

Regulatory Reform

Maine gaming regulators initiated several reforms to the
state’s casino gaming regulations in 2022.

In November, the Maine Gambling Control Unit published
updated minimum internal control standards—or MICS—
applicable to commercial casinos. The updated standards
largely proposed technical amendments to Maine’s
existing MICS but did include new guidelines applicable to
electronic table games, among other things.

In August, the Maine Gambling Control Board also adopted
updated regulations applicable to the self-exclusion
programs offered by the state’s two commercial casinos.
