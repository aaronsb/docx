In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

MASSACHUSETTS

revenue was a record $1.13 billion, up 10.9 percent
from 2021. Additionally, Massachusetts lawmakers

approved legislation legalizing sports betting.

Market Overview

Massachusetts offers commercial casino gaming at two casino-resorts operating
electronic gaming devices and table games and at one racino, which is
restricted to electronic gaming devices.

Casino gaming was legalized in 2011 when the legislature passed a law
authorizing commercial gaming at three casino-resorts in different regions of
the state, plus an additional “Category 2” facility limited to electronic gaming
devices. The law also established the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to
issue licenses for the four properties and to regulate their operations.

Massachusetts’ Category 2 casino was opened alongside Plainridge Park, a
harness racing track in Plainville, in 2015. The MGM Springfield and Encore
Boston Harbor casino-resorts later opened in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

The license for Massachusetts’ fourth and final casino was designated under
the 2011 law for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to develop a tribal casino in
the southeastern region of the state. The Mashpee project has faced a series
of legal challenges, however, while the Massachusetts Gaming Commission has
so far declined to move forward with licensing an alternative commercial casino
project in the same region.

In 2022, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill to authorize sports
wagering at the state’s commercial casino and racing facilities as well as
through affiliated and standalone mobile sportsbook platforms. At the end of
the year, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission was still in the process of
adopting regulations and conducting licensing investigations in order to fully
implement the sports betting law.
