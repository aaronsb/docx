Helping comparisons: for the first two months of 2021,
casinos were able to accommodate no more than 200
guests at a time due to operating restrictions put in place
to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. No such restrictions
were in place during 2022.

Electronic gaming devices at Maine’s two commercial casino
properties generated a total of $139.8 million in revenue in
2022, up 10.3 percent relative to the previous year. Table
game revenue was $25.2 million, up 25.3 percent.

Oxford Casino solidified its position as the more lucrative
of Maine’s two commercial casinos in 2022. Oxford Casino
generated total gaming revenue of approximately $107.8
million, up 15.6 percent versus the prior year. Hollywood
Casino Bangor meanwhile reported $57.2 million in
revenue, up 6.3 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Maine’s two commercial casinos are subject to different
tax rates. Hollywood Casino, as a racino property, pays 39
percent of electronic gaming device revenue and 1 percent
of electronic gaming device handle in taxes. Oxford Casino,
as a standalone casino, is subject to a tax rate of 46
percent of electronic gaming device revenue. Both casinos
pay 16 percent of their table game revenue in taxes.

In 2022, Maine’s commercial casinos generated total
gaming tax revenue of $68.2 million, up 11.4 percent from
the previous year.

The biggest recipients of gaming tax dollars in Maine

are the state’s Department of Education to support K-12
school programs, scholarship programs to state and
community colleges, and a state fund established in 2000
to provide prevention-related services and other healthcare
programs for Maine families. Gaming tax revenue is also
distributed to support the state’s horse racing industry,
agricultural programs and the local governments that host
commercial casinos.

Competitive Landscape

Maine’s commercial casinos operate at the outer edge of a
New England market that includes commercial and tribal
casino-resorts in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.

Following the opening of Encore Boston Harbor in
Massachusetts in 2019 there is limited new regional
competition on the horizon in terms of casino-resorts.
However electronic gaming devices based on historical
horse races became operational at charitable gaming
locations in New Hampshire in 2022, in line with
legislation approved the previous year.

Maine’s wider gaming market also includes six racing and
off-track betting facilities. While these locations do not
currently offer any form of casino gaming, they will be
eligible to offer sports wagering alongside the state’s two
casinos, in accordance with legislation approved by Maine
lawmakers in 2022.

Similarly, Maine is home to four federally recognized Indian
tribes that do not operate casino gaming on Indian lands.
While there have been several failed attempts by the state
legislature to authorize tribal gaming, Maine’s Indian tribes
will be eligible in future to operate statewide mobile sports
wagering.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In May, Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed into law a bill to
authorize land-based and online sports betting in Maine.

Under the legislation, mobile sports betting may be
operated exclusively by Maine’s federally recognized Indian
tribes. Tribes will be able to outsource the operation of
their online sportsbook platforms, but would still have to
retain a significant portion of the overall revenue.

Retail sports betting will be permitted at Maine’s two
commercial casino locations as well as at licensed
racetracks and off-track betting facilities.

At the conclusion of 2022, implementing regulations
for sports wagering were still to be drafted by the Maine
