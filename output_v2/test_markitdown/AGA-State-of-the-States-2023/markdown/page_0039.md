Gaming Tax Distribution

Florida’s commercial casinos are taxed at a rate of 35
percent of electronic gaming device revenue.

In 2022, Florida commercial casinos generated total tax
revenue of $242.9 million, up 6.9 percent from the prior
year.

Under Florida law, all tax revenue from commercial casinos
is deposited into Florida’s Educational Enhancement

Trust Fund (EETF). The fund was established in 1986

to allocate annual revenue from the then-newly created
Florida Lottery for school districts, public colleges and
universities. Additional sums are also used to provide
financial aid to Florida students. Each year, the Florida
Legislature determines which programs are funded and at
what level under the EETF.

Competitive Landscape

Florida’s commercial casinos face significant competition
from the state’s seven tribal casinos, six of which are
owned and operated by the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

In addition to electronic gaming devices, the Seminole
casinos are eligible to offer blackjack and baccarat. In
2021, the tribe agreed a new compact with the state
enabling it offer roulette, craps, and both land-based and
online sports betting; however, that agreement has been
since been mired in federal court challenges.

Card rooms at Florida racetracks and jai alai frontons
outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties also offer
gaming, but are limited to the operation of non-banked
card games, such as poker.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Tribal Gaming

In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District

of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in the appeal of
the U.S. Department of Interior and the Seminole Tribe of
Florida to reinstate the landmark gaming compact inked by
the tribe and state of Florida in April 2021.

The owner of one of Florida’s commercial racinos
successfully argued before a lower court that the compact
was invalid since it authorized the Seminole Tribe to offer
mobile sports betting to players located throughout the
state and gaming would not be confined to Indian lands in
accordance with federal law. Other provisions of the 30-
year compact would allow the Seminole Tribe to develop
three new casino-resorts on its reservation land near Fort
Lauderdale and offer craps, roulette and sports betting in
its existing tribal casinos.

remains smaller overall than those of fellow southern states

Lawyers for the federal government and the Seminole Tribe
argued that the Interior Department acted within its authority
when it allowed the compact to take effect in August 2021,
and that the agreement duly complies with the 1988 Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act which governs tribal gaming.

In a related development, the Interior Department’s
Bureau of Indian Affairs earlier in December proposed
updated regulations regarding the compacting process
for so-called Class Il tribal casino gaming. Among other
things, the revised rules would expressly allow approval
of compacts, such as the 2021 agreement between the
Seminole Tribe and the state of Florida, which authorize
a tribe to conduct statewide mobile gaming via servers
located on reservation lands.

Expansion

In February, an effort to expand commercial casino gaming
to locations outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties
fell short when proponents were unable to gather a
sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the November
2022 statewide ballot.

The proposed initiative would have authorized existing pari-
mutuel racing facilities in counties throughout Florida to
be licensed to offer casino gaming, provided they agreed to
invest at least $250 million in developing a casino-resort
and were located a minimum of 130 miles away from any
of the Seminole Tribe’s casinos.
