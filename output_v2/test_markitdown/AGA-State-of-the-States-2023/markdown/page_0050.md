Kansas offers commercial casino gaming at four state-owned casinos, which
are developed and managed by private companies. The casinos, which are
permitted to offer electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting,
are operated under the constitutional authority of the Kansas Lottery and are
regulated by the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission (KRGC).

In 2007, the legislature approved the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, which
authorized the creation of four “lottery gaming facilities,” one in each of the
four designated gaming zones throughout the state. The four casinos opened
between 2009 and 2017.

In 2022, lawmakers approved legislation authorizing Kansas’ commercial
casinos to operate sports betting via land-based sportsbooks within their casino
properties, through kiosks installed at partnering retail locations, as well as
through a maximum of three branded mobile platforms for each casino. Land-
based and online sports betting went live at three of the four casinos and via six
mobile sportsbook platforms in September.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $478.1
million, up 18.5 percent from the previous year.

The record total reflected the addition of legal sports betting to Kansas’
commercial gaming market. After launching in early September, online and
land-based sportsbooks reported total gross sports wagering revenue of $76.5
