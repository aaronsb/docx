percent. iGaming revenue was a record $13.6 million, up
29.0 percent.

In contrast with the other forms of gaming, sports betting
revenue declined in 2022. Facing expanded out-of-state
competition from legal sportsbooks launched at Maryland
casinos, combined sports betting revenue from Delaware
racinos’ sports wagering operations and sports lottery
parlays was $17.3 million, a decline of 33.2 percent from
the previous year.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Delaware’s commercial casinos are subject to an effective
tax rate of approximately 56 percent on their gross revenue
from electronic gaming devices and a 20 percent tax on
their gross table game revenue, both inclusive of payments
used to subsidize race purses.

The effective taxation structure applied to iGaming
offerings is roughly the same as the structure applied to
the equivalent games in racinos. However, racinos are
entitled to a share of iGaming revenue only after the total
amount generated in any year surpasses $3.75 million.

Meanwhile, Delaware racinos retain approximately 40
percent of revenue from sports betting. The state keeps 50
percent of revenue but must pay additional commissions to
providers of the Delaware Lottery’s sports betting system
and risk-management services. Approximately 10 percent

2009 to 2022

While revenue from traditional land-based casino games
and iGaming increased in 2022, Delaware’s sports betting
market declined by more than a third compared with the

of sports betting revenue is distributed to the local horse
racing industry.

In 2022, Delaware’s racinos and sports lottery retailers
generated total gaming tax revenue of approximately
$225.1 million, up 1.3 percent versus the previous year.

Of the total tax revenue generated by commercial gaming
operations in 2022, approximately $177 million was
returned to Delaware’s General Fund which is appropriated
annually for various purposes, including public and higher
education, health and social services and public safety. An
additional $48 million was allocated to Delaware’s racing
industry for the purpose of supplementing race purses.

Competitive Landscape

Delaware racinos compete in a crowded Mid-Atlantic
market that includes more than two-dozen commercial
casinos in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Delaware Park Casino, located near Wilmington,
directly competes for patrons in a Greater Philadelphia
market served by five casinos and racinos.

While Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada
to offer legal sports betting following the 2018 ruling of
the U.S. Supreme Court, sportsbook operations are now
available in each of its bordering states following the
launch of retail sports wagering at Maryland’s commercial
casinos in December 2021. Mobile sports betting was also
launched in Maryland in late 2022.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming

In April, Delaware, with Nevada and New Jersey,
announced that Michigan would join the Multi-State
Internet Gaming Association as the fourth member.

The association enables participating states to collaborate
in offering certain types of iGaming—specifically peer-to-
peer online poker games—on an interstate basis, in order
to offer larger player and prize pools.

Delaware and Nevada were the original states to sign the
Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement in 2014. New
Jersey became a member in 2017.
