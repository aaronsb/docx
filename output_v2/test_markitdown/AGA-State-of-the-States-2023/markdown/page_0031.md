programs. Plans should include information regarding
staffing levels, tools available to players, as well as details
of how operators plan to use player data and technology
to aid in identifying potential problem gamblers through
automated triggers based on patron activity.

Another provision of the gaming bill signed into law by Gov.
Polis in June made changes to the tax regime applicable to
sports betting.

As a result of the new legislation, effective January 2023,
sports betting operators will no longer be permitted to
deduct an unlimited amount of promotional credits, free
bets and bonuses from their taxable revenue in Colorado.
Instead, operators may deduct no more than the equivalent
of 2.5 percent of total wagering handle through June
2024, with permitted deductions being further reduced
each year until they are capped at 1.75 percent of handle
from July 2026.

In a separate policy change related to sports betting, the
Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission adopted
new regulations in March to permit sportsbook operators
to offer fixed-odds wagers on horse or greyhound races
subject to approval by the Colorado Racing Commission
and other parties. The new regulations also clarified the
regulatory process for approving new sports wagering
events in general.

Regulatory Reform

Also in June, Gov. Polis signed a separate gaming-related
bill to make several amendments to state laws applicable
to commercial casino gaming.

Among other things, the legislation granted the Colorado
Limited Gaming Control Commission broader authority to
combat illegal gambling at unlicensed establishments that
offer unregulated electronic gaming devices in any part of
the state. Previously, the commission’s regulatory authority
was restricted to the three Colorado towns authorized to
host commercial casino gaming.

Further regulatory changes introduced by the legislation
included reducing the minimum age requirement to work in
a Colorado commercial casino from 21 to 18, and granting
the gaming commission authority to waive a fingerprinting
requirement in the case of license applications submitted
by international sports betting companies.
