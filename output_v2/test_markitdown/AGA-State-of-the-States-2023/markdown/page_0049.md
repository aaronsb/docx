Payments Modernization

The legal provisions imposing a moratorium on new casino
licenses were enacted as part of a wider gaming reform bill
passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Gov.
Reynolds.

The bill also cleared the way for cashless wagering on

the gaming floors of lowa commercial casinos, clarifying
that statutory prohibitions related to the dispensing of

cash or credit in casinos would not apply to a cashless
wagering system that was being accessed through a mobile
application operated by the casino.

The bill also amended lowa’s sports wagering law to permit
operators to offer bets on “sports-related events,” such

as the outcome of pro sports drafts or individual player
awards, that are not directly determined on the field of
play. Prior to the statutory change, lowa regulators had
determined that such wagering events were not permissible
under state law.

As initially passed by the lowa House, the gaming reform
bill signed in June also would have authorized wagering
on esports contests. Provisions related to esports were
removed from the legislation in the Senate, however.
