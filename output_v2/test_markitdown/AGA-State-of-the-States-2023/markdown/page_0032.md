Connecticut’s iGaming and sports betting programs
generated $416.2 million in combined revenue in

2022, their first full year of operation.

Market Overview

Connecticut has no commercial casino venues but offers iGaming through
commercial internet casinos affiliated with the state’s two sovereign tribal
nations, the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot.

Sports betting is also offered by three online sportsbook platforms affiliated
with the two tribes and with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. The state
lottery is also eligible to offer in-person sports betting at up to 15 land-based
locations, of which nine were operational at the end of 2022.

Both iGaming and sports betting were legalized through a May 2021 law that
granted the governor authority to renegotiate the state’s tribal gaming compacts
to include sports wagering, iGaming, fantasy sports and online lottery games.

Commercial gaming in Connecticut is regulated by the state’s Department of
Consumer Protection.

Market Performance

In 2022, total commercial gaming revenue from iGaming and sports wagering
in Connecticut was $416.2 million. That represented an increase of more than
430 percent from the total generated in three months of operation in 2021,
after iGaming and sports betting began in October that year.

Revenue from iGaming was $280.7 million, versus $47.6 million in 2021.
Sports betting revenue was $135.5 million, versus $30.9 million.
