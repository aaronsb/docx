Responsible Gaming and Cybersecurity

Establishing greater consumer protections for gaming
patrons in an expanding and increasingly digital
commercial gaming market was a key policy theme across
various states in 2022.

Officials in Colorado, Louisiana and South Dakota all
adopted new regulations to establish enhanced responsible
gaming requirements for land-based casino gaming or online
sports betting, while regulators in New Jersey finalized

new best practices for responsible gaming applicable to all
iGaming and mobile sports betting operators. Lawmakers

in Colorado, Illinois and Michigan also agreed to allocate
greater funding to responsible gaming programs.

On another front, regulators in Nevada, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania introduced new regulatory requirements to
better protect casino or iGaming patrons from risks of
cyber fraud that can affect gaming operations just like
other industries holding large amounts of consumer data.

Illegal Gaming

Another key challenge for the commercial casino gaming
industry in 2022 was ongoing competition from illegal
gaming operations.

According to new AGA research, Americans gamble an
estimated $511 billion annually with illegal and unregulated
sportsbooks, iGaming websites and unregulated electronic
gaming devices in bars, convenience stores and other
non-casino locations. These illegal operations generate
estimated revenue of $44.2 billion—or almost 75 percent
of the total generated by legal commercial casino gaming

in 2022—and deprive state governments of an estimated
$13.3 billion in annual tax revenue.

Virginia, Kansas and Colorado all passed legislation of some
kind in 2022 to facilitate law enforcement efforts to tackle
illegal electronic gaming device operations, although similar
measures proposed in Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania
failed to win approval by the end of the year. According to
AGA research, there are an estimated 580,651 unregulated
electronic gaming devices in operation across the United
States, meaning approximately 40 percent of all electronic
gaming devices in the country are not subject to licensing
and other consumer protections.

Annual U.S. Tribal Gaming Revenue
2017 to 2021

According to statistics published by the National Indian
Gaming Commission, revenue from tribal gaming
operations reached a record total of $39.0 billion in 2021,
up 40.2 percent compared to 2020 when tribal casinos
were forced to close due to the pandemic. Comparable
revenue statistics for 2022 will be published by the NIGC
later in 2023. When tribal gaming revenue is combined
with reported commercial casino gaming revenue, it is
expected that total U.S. gaming revenue will likely have
exceeded $100 billion for the first time in 2022.
