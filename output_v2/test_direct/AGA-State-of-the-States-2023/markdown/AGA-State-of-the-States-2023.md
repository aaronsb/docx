THE AGA ANALYSIS OF THE
COMMERCIAL CASINO INDUSTRY

A Message from the American Gaming Association

May 2023

Dear Gaming Industry Colleague:

I am pleased to present State of the States 2023: The AGA
Survey of the Commercial Casino Industry, the American
Gaming Association’s (AGA) signature research report
and the definitive economic analysis of U.S. commercial
gaming in 2022.

Without a doubt, 2022 was a remarkable year for the U.S.
commercial gaming sector and for the AGA. This is all
despite lingering challenges from the pandemic early in the
year and widespread questions about the overall health of
the economy in the latter half of the year.

Continued strong consumer demand for gaming
entertainment generated record-breaking commercial
gaming revenue of $60 billion in 2022, a 14 percent
increase from the previous year. When tribal gaming
revenue numbers are reported later this year, total
U.S. gaming revenue will likely exceed $100 billion, an
exceptional achievement amid the still ongoing recovery of
international visitation, business travel and conventions.

Our industry has a long history of adapting to changing
operating environments and consumer preferences. Over
the past three years that ability has enabled us to weather
the storm of 2020 and end 2022 as an industry about 30
percent bigger than we were in 2019, with a different mix
of consumers, markets and gaming verticals than just a
few years ago.

Last year, 84 million American adults visited a casino,
with the average age on the casino floor falling to about
42 years old, down from nearly 50 years old in 2019.
More than half of American adults live in jurisdictions
that feature access to legal, regulated sports betting, and
iGaming is significantly growing the overall revenue picture
in the states where it is legal.

As commercial gaming and online sports betting
expanded into new markets last year, we have continued
to engage lawmakers, regulators and the public, ensuring
these critical stakeholders appreciate our commitment
to sustainable relationships with consumers and
local communities. In addition to maintaining trusted
relationships with policymakers and serving as a reliable
resource for insight and industry perspectives, we also
drove industry collaboration to advance our common
interests. Last year, with the support of our members, we
continued to set a high bar for responsible marketing and
promotion, uniting the broader sports betting ecosystem
around responsible gaming via AGA’s Have A Game Plan.®
Bet Responsibly.™ campaign.

Here in Washington, the AGA advocated for industry
priorities, including sound tax policy, modernization of
anti-money laundering regulations, and other issues that
impact our members. In 2022, we worked with travel
partners to pass the Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act,
creating the first ever unified tourism strategy across the
federal government. We built bipartisan congressional
support to press the Department of Justice to crack on
down illegal gambling. We will continue to advance these
and other important issues—including the repeal of the
federal sports betting excise tax and an increase to the slot
tax reporting threshold—over the coming months.

Finally, G2E Las Vegas brought together nearly 25,000
members of the industry for the premier gaming event of
the year, where the global gaming community convenes
to do business, make connections and drive the future of
gaming. The show floor radiated with energy and reinforced
our industry’s strength.

After decades of relatively steady, low-key growth, our
industry is coming off two record years of gaming revenue
and we are part of the national conversation in a way that
we’ve never been before. It is an exciting time to be in
gaming, and the AGA remains focused on safeguarding
gaming’s standing in the political, business and social
spheres. I look forward to working with you all again this
year to maintain our leading position in the world of travel,
entertainment and gaming.

With detailed information on the U.S. gaming market
and financial performance data for every commercial
gaming state, State of the States 2023 provides the most
comprehensive economic guide to the commercial casino
industry. I would like to thank our partners at VIXIO
GamblingCompliance for their invaluable assistance in its
creation.

I hope you will find this a useful reference and, as always,
thank you for your continued partnership.

Sincerely,

William C. Miller, Jr.
President and CEO
American Gaming Association

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the
commercial casino gaming industry in each of the 35
jurisdictions with legal commercial casino gaming or sports
betting as of December 31, 2022.

For each of the jurisdictions, the report analyzes gaming
revenue and gaming taxes generated by commercial casino
locations, as well as sports betting and iGaming platforms,
for the calendar year 2022. In addition, the report provides
an overview of the primary competition faced by the
gaming industry in each state and summarizes the year’s
major gaming policy discussions in each jurisdiction.

Tables at the beginning of this report provide a comparative
summary of the main licensing, taxation, and responsible
gaming requirements applied to casino and sports betting
operators, as well as to suppliers of electronic gaming
devices and table game equipment. This report defines
commercial casino locations as licensed land-based
casinos, riverboat casinos, racetrack casinos (racinos),
and jai alai frontons with gaming operations. It also
includes casino locations in states such as Delaware,
New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island that offer electronic
gaming devices classified as video lottery terminals and
are operated by commercial casinos under the authority of
those states’ lotteries.

For the purposes of identifying commercial casino location
numbers, we do not include certain other types of gaming
locations, such as horse or dog racetracks without
electronic gaming devices, historical horse racing terminal
locations or off-track betting operations, lottery retail
locations, charitable gaming venues, tribal gaming facilities
as defined by the National Indian Gaming Commission,
card rooms or other locations at which gaming is incidental
to the primary business.

State gaming and tax revenue totals do not include revenue
and taxes from these non-commercial casino locations,
with the exception of Nevada. Due to its unique nature,
revenue and tax data from some Nevada locations which
offer “non-restricted” gaming as incidental to their primary
business is included.

Also excluded from state gaming revenue and tax totals is
revenue derived from convenience locations with electronic
gaming devices—such as video lottery terminals or video
gaming terminals—in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and West Virginia.
The competitive impact of each of the above operations,
however, is noted where warranted.

State gaming revenue and tax totals do include iGaming
operations managed by commercial casinos or affiliated
companies in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Nevada,

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The totals
also include all revenue from land-based and online
sports betting in each of the states with legal sports
betting, with the exception of land-based sports betting
revenue earned by tribal casinos. Such totals include
sports betting revenue derived from a handful of non-
casino locations, such as racetracks, sports stadiums,
off-track betting outlets, and standalone sportsbook
locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,
Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C.

Sports betting handle and revenue information is reported
differently across states. In certain states, including
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and
Wyoming, total sports betting revenue reflects the “gross
revenue” reported by sportsbooks prior to deductions to
account for promotional spending or free-bet promotions
extended to players. Further, certain states, including
Nevada, use an accrual method of accounting that
includes only revenue from completed events. Others,
including New Jersey, utilize a cash method of accounting.
Under this accounting, bets made during 2022 on future
events, such as the 2023 Super Bowl or World Series
winner, for example, are included in 2022 revenue and
future monthly revenue reports would be adjusted to
reflect the outcome of those sporting events and whether
operators paid out winnings to customers. Readers should
consult the websites of state regulatory agencies for more
information on how each state accounts for sports betting
revenue. Due to reporting restrictions, commercial casino
gaming revenue does not include revenue derived from
parimutuel betting on horse races at commercial casino
race and sportsbooks, except for such revenue derived at
Nevada commercial casinos.

This report uses the term “electronic gaming device” to
refer to the various types of gaming devices installed in
casinos, commonly known as “slot machines.” Although
the general public may not differentiate between the
various types of electronic gaming devices, there are
often important regulatory and technological distinctions
between them and specific legal definitions are applied to
different categories of devices in different states. State-
specific terminology for electronic gaming devices includes
video lottery terminals (VLTs), video gaming terminals
(VGTs), video poker, and electronic gaming machines,
among others.

All references to “gaming revenue” are used as a
substitute for more specific financial terms—including
“casino win,” “adjusted gross receipts,” “gross gaming
revenue” and others—as reported by state regulatory

About This Report

agencies. Gaming regulatory agencies in each state report
monthly and annual revenue differently and readers should
consult those agencies’ websites for further information.

In general, gaming revenue refers to the amount earned
by commercial casinos after winnings have been paid
out to patrons. Importantly, gaming revenue does not
equate to profits earned by commercial casinos from their
operations. Such revenue is earned before properties pay
for various operating expenses, marketing, and employee
salaries, as well as various taxes and fees, among other
things.

Similarly, gaming tax revenue figures listed in the report
reflect only specific gaming taxes paid by casinos, iGaming
platforms, and commercial sportsbook operations out of
revenue won from patrons. They do not include various
other state, local, and federal taxes that apply to casinos
as they do to most other businesses. They also do not
include the federal excise tax of 0.25 percent generally
applied to sports betting handle across most states, nor
the $50 fee per sportsbook employee that businesses that
pay the excise tax must also pay.

For the purposes of calculating state gaming tax revenue
totals, reported tax figures include taxes directed to state
and local governments and the specific casino gaming
revenue funds established by those entities. They also
include mandatory allocations of gaming revenue from
commercial gaming operations to non-government entities,
such as problem gambling services, race purses, breeding
programs, and other funds used to support local racing
industries.

In certain states, gaming is operated under the authority
of the state government, and a portion of casino revenue
is then redistributed to private operators. Where this is the
case, this report considers the effective tax rate applied
to gaming operators to be the portion of gaming revenue
retained by the state or its designated beneficiaries.

Information on supplier licensing in the table in this report
is limited to those supplier entities that either manufacture
electronic gaming devices or table game equipment or
distribute or otherwise sell them to casinos. In many
states, additional licensing requirements are applicable
to the suppliers of various other goods and services to
casinos. Readers are advised to consult the websites
of state gaming regulatory agencies for more specific
information.

STATE OF THE INDUSTRY

Despite persistent concerns about the financial health of American consumers

throughout 2022, the U.S. commercial casino gaming industry generated

record-breaking revenue for a second consecutive year.

Annual U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenue
2007-2022
In 2022, total nationwide consumer spending on commercial
casino gaming and sports betting increased by 14.0
percent to a record $60.46 billion. The total marked the
first time annual commercial gaming revenue surpassed
$60 billion and came just one year after the industry first
broke through the $50 billion barrier.

The increase in revenue reflected growth in both traditional
casino gaming revenue from electronic gaming devices
and table games in land-based casinos, as well as much
smaller but fast-growing sports betting and iGaming
verticals

COMMERCIAL CASINO GAMING CONSUMER SPEND BY STATE
2021 vs. 2022

COMMERCIAL CASINO DIRECT GAMING TAX REVENUE BY STATE
2021 vs. 2022

All but three of the 35 jurisdictions with commercial casino
or sports betting operations in 2022 reported an increase in
gaming revenue compared with the prior year, with only the
District of Columbia, Mississippi and South Dakota seeing a
revenue decline. All-time record annual commercial gaming
revenue was reported by 27 of the 35 states.

This year, Nebraska joined the ranks of commercial gaming
states following the opening of its first two land-based
casinos. Virginia also reported its first revenue from land-
based casino gaming following the opening of the state’s
first casino.

The strong growth in gaming revenue translated into a
record $13.49 billion in direct gaming tax revenue paid
to state and local governments by commercial gaming
operations. The tax total represented an increase of 15.3
percent from 2021. Notably, the $13.49 billion figure
reflects only specific state and local taxes that are applied
directly to gaming activities. It does not include the billions
more paid by the industry in the form of income, sales,
and various other corporate taxes, nor does the total reflect
payroll taxes paid by gaming operators and suppliers. Also
excluded are federal excise tax payments made by sports
betting operators.

Top 20 US Commercial Casino Markets
In 2022, 14 of the top 20 commercial casino gaming
markets posted revenue growth compared to the previous
year. The Las Vegas Strip and Black Hawk/Central City
region in Colorado had significant gains year-over-year,
while the southern markets of Tunica/Lula and Shreveport/
Bossier City were impacted by increased competition from
casinos in nearby states and reported notable declines in
annual revenue.

The Las Vegas Strip remained by far the largest casino
gaming market in the country in 2022. The Strip saw

fewer visitors in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic years,
but those who did go spent more on gaming entertainment
per visit than in the past. Elsewhere, the Baltimore-
Washington D.C. market reclaimed its position as the third
largest commercial casino gaming market in the country in
2022, with the MGM National Harbor resort just beyond
Washington D.C. city limits in Maryland generating more
gaming revenue than any commercial casino outside of
Nevada during the year.

Consumer Spending Trends
According to AGA survey data, 34 percent of the adult
population or 84 million American adults visited a casino
in 2022, up 6 percentage points from 2020 and 2021 but
still 10 points below the pre-pandemic high in 2019.

Compared to previous years, the average American casino
visitor in 2022 was younger and more interested in gaming
relative to other forms of entertainment. The average age
of a casino patron in 2022 was 42.4 years old, down from
43.6 in 2021 and 49.6 prior to the pandemic in 2019.
Roughly half of casino patrons visited a casino primarily or
mostly to gamble last year, whereas prior to the pandemic
most casino visitors were there primarily or mostly for non-
gaming entertainment.

Reflecting the trend toward a more gaming-oriented
casino patron, average gaming spend per casino visit
remained higher in 2022 compared to the years prior
to the pandemic. According to available data from five
midwestern and southern states—Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Missouri—average casino gaming revenue
per admission was largely unchanged from 2021 but still
up significantly from 2019 levels.

Growth Through Traditional and
Internet Casino Gaming
Across the 27 states with land-based commercial casinos,
revenue from traditional casino games was a record $47.83
billion in 2022, up 6.4 percent versus the prior year.

Among the 25 states that reported separate revenue
statistics for electronic gaming devices and table games,
revenue from electronic gaming devices grew 5.1 percent
year-over-year to $34.19 billion, while table game revenue
increased 13.9 percent to $10.00 billion. Revenue for both
tables and slot gaming were records for each segment.

Overall, 23 of the 27 states with land-based commercial
casinos reported an increase in revenue from traditional
casino gaming in 2022. The only exceptions were Kansas,
Michigan, Mississippi and South Dakota, with competition
from tribal gaming operations impacting revenue in
the former two states and the latter two facing difficult
annual comparisons after particularly strong revenue
performances in 2021.

Annual Internet Gaming Revenue

UNITED STATES: REGULATED IGAMING GGR – 2014 TO 2022

2014 to 2022
Internet casinos continued their strong growth in 2022
despite no new states coming online. Combined iGaming
revenue across the six states with lawful online casinos
reached a record total of $5.02 billion, up 35.3 percent
compared to the previous year. New Jersey, Michigan and
Pennsylvania accounted for more than 88 percent of the
nationwide total. Each of the those three states secured
positions in the top five largest regulated internet casino
gaming markets in the world, with annual revenue of $1.66
billion, $1.38 billion and $1.36 billion, respectively. In its
first full year of operation, Connecticut reported iGaming
revenue of $280.7 million.

Despite the impressive revenue growth, however, no
additional states acted to legalize iGaming in 2022,
although legislation was considered by lawmakers in at
least seven states, including Indiana, Illinois and New York.

Annual Sports Betting Revenue
2019 to 2022
Fueled by the launch of mobile sports betting in New York,
the U.S. sports betting market continued to grow during the
fourth full year since 2018’s historic U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that permitted all states to regulate sports wagering.

The regulated U.S. sports betting market generated total
revenue of $7.56 billion in 2022, not including sportsbook
operations in tribal casinos. That total marked an increase
of almost 75 percent on the prior year. The increase in
revenue came as Americans legally bet some $93.73
billion, compared to a handle of $57.53 billion in 2021.

New York accounted for $1.37 billion—or more than 18
percent—of the national revenue total, as the Empire

State’s launch of online sports betting in January saw it
become comfortably the largest legal sports betting market
in the country. Illinois was the nation’s second largest sports
betting market in 2022, while New Jersey fell from first to
third position as the state reported a year-over-year decline
in annual sports wagering revenue, largely reflecting the
expanded competition from its northern neighbor.

By the end of 2022, legal sports betting was available in
32 states plus the District of Columbia. Kansas, Maine and
Massachusetts all passed legislation to authorize sports
betting during the year, with the Kansas market going
live in September just prior to the 2022 football season.
Alongside New York, mobile sports betting was launched in
Louisiana, Arkansas and Maryland.

Responsible Gaming and Cybersecurity
Establishing greater consumer protections for gaming
patrons in an expanding and increasingly digital
commercial gaming market was a key policy theme across
various states in 2022.

Officials in Colorado, Louisiana and South Dakota all
adopted new regulations to establish enhanced responsible
gaming requirements for land-based casino gaming or online
sports betting, while regulators in New Jersey finalized
new best practices for responsible gaming applicable to all
iGaming and mobile sports betting operators. Lawmakers
in Colorado, Illinois and Michigan also agreed to allocate
greater funding to responsible gaming programs.

On another front, regulators in Nevada, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania introduced new regulatory requirements to
better protect casino or iGaming patrons from risks of
cyber fraud that can affect gaming operations just like
other industries holding large amounts of consumer data.

Illegal Gaming
Another key challenge for the commercial casino gaming
industry in 2022 was ongoing competition from illegal
gaming operations.

According to new AGA research, Americans gamble an
estimated $511 billion annually with illegal and unregulated
sportsbooks, iGaming websites and unregulated electronic
gaming devices in bars, convenience stores and other
non-casino locations. These illegal operations generate
estimated revenue of $44.2 billion—or almost 75 percent
of the total generated by legal commercial casino gaming
in 2022—and deprive state governments of an estimated
$13.3 billion in annual tax revenue.

Virginia, Kansas and Colorado all passed legislation of some
kind in 2022 to facilitate law enforcement efforts to tackle
illegal electronic gaming device operations, although similar
measures proposed in Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania
failed to win approval by the end of the year. According to
AGA research, there are an estimated 580,651 unregulated
electronic gaming devices in operation across the United
States, meaning approximately 40 percent of all electronic
gaming devices in the country are not subject to licensing
and other consumer protections.

Selected States: Annual VGT Revenue
2012 to 2022
Electronic gaming devices in non-casino locations across
seven reporting states generated revenue of more than
$6.05 billion in the 2022 fiscal year, up 25.0 percent
versus 2021. Illinois remained by far the largest market for
convenience electronic gaming devices, with total annual
revenue from the state’s 45,000 video gaming terminals,
or VGTs, reaching $2.71 billion in 2022.

Annual U.S. Tribal Gaming Revenue
2017 to 2021
According to statistics published by the National Indian
Gaming Commission, revenue from tribal gaming
operations reached a record total of $39.0 billion in 2021,
up 40.2 percent compared to 2020 when tribal casinos
were forced to close due to the pandemic. Comparable
revenue statistics for 2022 will be published by the NIGC
later in 2023. When tribal gaming revenue is combined
with reported commercial casino gaming revenue, it is
expected that total U.S. gaming revenue will likely have
exceeded $100 billion for the first time in 2022.

Arizona reported total sports wagering revenue of

$482.9 million in 2022, making the state’s sports

Market Overview
Arizona has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through
commercial sportsbook operators subject to regulation by the Arizona
Department of Gaming.

A state law passed in April 2021 authorized land-based sports betting at
Arizona’s major professional sports arenas and facilities, as well as at up to
10 racetrack or off-track betting locations. Online sports betting can also
be offered by a maximum of 20 licensed platforms partnered with either a
professional sports team or facility, or with one of Arizona’s federally recognized
Indian tribes.

At the end of 2022, commercial sports betting was offered at 13 retail
sportsbook locations and through 17 online betting platforms.

Market Performance
In 2022, total gross sports betting revenue in Arizona was $482.9 million,
almost triple the 2021 total of $161.1 million that was derived from less than
four months of operations. More than 99 percent of the 2022 revenue total
came from online sports betting, rather than retail.

The overall revenue total made Arizona the fifth largest sports betting market
in the country in 2022, behind only New York, Illinois, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from land-based sports betting in Arizona is
taxed at a rate of 8 percent, while revenue from online
sports betting is taxed at 10 percent. The tax is applied
after limited deductions of free bets and other bonuses
and promotions, up to a maximum of 20 percent of total
revenue in 2022. Sportsbook operations are further
subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied
to wagering handle. Federal excise payments are also
deductible from revenue subject to the state’s sports
betting tax.

In 2022, sports betting generated total state tax revenue
of approximately $28.9 million, a more than four-fold
increase compared with the previous year.

Under the state’s 2021 legislation, all revenue generated
through sports betting “privilege fees,” or taxes, are
deposited on a monthly basis into Arizona’s General Fund
and used for general state budgetary purposes as approved
by the legislature.

Competitive Landscape
Arizona’s commercial sports betting operations compete
with sportsbooks that can be offered in the state’s 27
tribal casinos in accordance with amendments to tribal
gaming compacts approved in 2021.

Aside from sports betting and tribal gaming, Arizona’s
broader gaming market includes a state lottery, charitable
bingo locations, three horse racetracks and around 60 off-
track betting facilities offering wagering on horse and dog
races.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In April 2022, the Arizona Department of Gaming
approved final regulations applicable to commercial sports
betting in the state.

The regulatory agency adopted its initial rules for mobile
and retail sports wagering on an emergency basis in July
2021 to facilitate the launch of legal sports betting in
time for the 2021 football season. The department’s final
regulations were promulgated after a further comment
period and included several revisions from those initial
rules, including changes related to license renewals,
advertising, and procedures in the event of the closure of a
licensed sports betting operation.

Separately, the Arizona Department of Gaming in January
allocated the state’s ten available so-called limited event
wagering operator licenses. The recipients were Arizona
Downs Racetrack, eight off-track betting locations in the
Phoenix area, and another OTB facility in Tucson. Retail
sports betting began at the selected locations in June.

Another policy matter in focus in 2022 was the
discrepancy between the number of commercial sports
betting licenses available to Arizona Indian tribes and
those to the designated partners of the state’s major sports
teams and arenas.

A bill introduced in the Arizona Senate in February would
have enabled all 23 federally recognized Indian tribes
in Arizona to apply for a mobile sports wagering license,
rather than the maximum of 10 under the state’s 2021
sports betting law. That proposed legislation died without
being passed out of committee.

In 2022, total casino gaming revenue reported by

Arkansas’ three commercial casino properties was

$614.1 million, an increase of 8.7 percent from 2021.

The record total included the first revenue from mobile

sports wagering, which began in March.

Market Overview

both on-site and mobile sports betting.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

GROSS CASINO GAMING REVENUE 2022
$614.1M

In 2018, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to allow casino
gaming at the state’s two racetracks, Oaklawn Park and Southland Park, as
well as at two new facilities located in Jefferson and Pope counties. Prior to the
constitutional amendment, gaming operations at the two tracks were restricted
to electronic gaming devices offering games of skill or games determined by the
outcome of historical horse races. Casino gaming and sports betting is regulated
by the Arkansas Racing Commission.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$614.1 million, up 8.7 percent versus the prior year.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $533.6 million, up
5.5 percent, while revenue from table games was $62.6 million, up 23.6 percent.

Bolstered by the launch of mobile sports betting, total sports wagering revenue
was $17.9 million, more than double 2021’s total of $8.5 million.

Gaming Tax Distribution
In accordance with 2018’s state constitutional
amendment, Arkansas commercial casinos are subject to
a graduated tax on their revenue. Casino revenue up to
$150 million is taxed at a rate of 13 percent, while a 20
percent rate is applied to any revenue above that amount.
Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Arkansas casinos and racinos generated
approximately $88.6 million in direct gaming tax revenue,
up 10.0 percent against the prior year.

Under Arkansas’ constitution, 55 percent of casino gaming
tax revenue is allocated to the state’s General Revenue Fund,
from which funds are appropriated each year for education,
public safety and various other purposes. A further 27.5
percent of tax revenue is distributed to the cities and
counties that host casinos, with the remainder used to
supplement race purses at the state’s two racetracks.

Competitive Landscape
In addition to competition among the state’s established
casinos and racinos, Arkansas gaming operators also
compete with various casino properties in neighboring
jurisdictions.

Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis competes directly
with several casinos in Tunica, Mississippi for patrons from
the Memphis metropolitan area, while several large-scale
tribal casino-resorts located just across Arkansas’ western
border in Oklahoma provide competition to Oaklawn Racing
Casino Resort as well as the pending casino in Pope County.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
Three years after the initial rollout of land-based sports
betting, Arkansas casinos became eligible in 2022 to
accept mobile wagers from patrons across the state.

Amended casino gaming regulations to allow statewide
mobile sports betting—crafted by the Arkansas Racing
Commission in late 2021—were approved by two state
legislative committees in February and became effective in
March. Notably, the new regulations were approved by the
legislature despite vocal objections from leading national
online sports betting operators to unique provisions that
require Arkansas casinos to receive at least 50 percent of
the revenue generated by any third-party platforms—or
“skins”—choosing to operate under their license.

Arkansas’ first mobile sportsbook went live in March and
by the end of the year, each of the state’s three active
commercial casinos and racinos had deployed their own
online sports betting platform.

Expansion
Litigation over Arkansas’ fourth and final commercial
casino license continued in 2022, without a definitive
resolution by the end of the year.

In December, a circuit court judge dismissed for lack of
standing one lawsuit filed by a group seeking to block a
casino altogether in Pope County. However, another lawsuit
filed by the losing applicant for the Pope County license
was scheduled to be heard by a separate judge in early
2023.

The litigation followed the Arkansas Racing Commission’s
decision in late 2022 to award the Pope County license
to a business subsidiary of Oklahoma’s Cherokee Nation.
Gulfside Casino Partnership’s lawsuit claimed that
Cherokee Nation Businesses and an affiliated casino
partner lacked sufficient experience to be awarded the
license for its $225 million casino-resort project.

An initial 2020 decision to award the Pope County casino
license to Gulfside Casino Partnership was successfully
challenged in court by the Cherokee Nation, based on the
fact that Gulfside did not have the requisite support of
local government officials currently in office at the time of
submitting its application.

In 2022, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue

reached a record $1.41 billion as casino operators

reported strong growth in both table game and sports

betting revenue.

Market Overview
Colorado offers commercial casino gaming at 33 facilities in three historic
towns—Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek—which were approved for
gaming by voters in a 1990 statewide referendum. Each of the casinos operates
electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting. The casinos can also
offer online sports betting in accordance with a state law approved by voters in
2019. At the end of 2022, 23 online sports platforms were available.

Commercial casino gaming and sports betting are regulated by the Colorado
Division of Gaming, which is supported by the Colorado Limited Gaming Control
Commission—a five-member regulatory oversight body appointed by the governor.

Colorado applies a graduated tax to electronic gaming
device and table game revenue, ranging from 0.25 percent
on revenue up to $2 million, to 20 percent on gaming
revenue of more than $13 million.

Sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 10 percent,
applied after limited deductions of free bets and other
bonuses and promotions. Sportsbook operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle. Federal excise payments are
also deductible from revenue subject to the state’s sports
betting tax.

In 2022, Colorado commercial casinos generated $187.7
million in gaming tax revenue, up 16.7 percent compared
to the prior year.

All gaming tax revenues from electronic gaming devices
and table games, including license and application fees,
are placed in the Colorado Limited Gaming Fund. After
deducting around $17.5 million to cover state costs
associated with gaming oversight and regulation of
casinos, the remaining money is distributed according to
the following formula:

•  50 percent to the “state share,” which funds grant

programs that benefit higher education, tourism and
select industries in Colorado

•  28 percent to a fund dedicated to historic

preservation and restoration

•  12 percent to the two counties that host commercial

casinos

•  10 percent to the three historic cities that host

commercial casinos

After deducting initial amounts to cover the state’s direct
costs of regulating sports wagering, and then setting aside
additional funding for Colorado colleges, local governments
hosting casinos and gambling addiction services, the
majority of remaining sports betting tax revenue is
distributed to a state water preservation fund. Some sports
betting tax revenue is also dedicated to the same historic
preservation fund that receives a portion of gaming tax
revenue generated by traditional casino games.

Competitive Landscape
Commercial casinos face limited competition from two
tribal casinos in the southern part of Colorado. One of the
tribal casinos also offers both retail and statewide online
sports betting pursuant to its tribal gaming compact.

The competitive environment for Colorado’s commercial
casinos is likely to remain stable in the near term, with the
addition of sports betting and removal of maximum wager
limits bolstering the casinos of Black Hawk, Cripple Creek
and Central City.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming
Colorado lawmakers and regulators took several measures
to bolster the state’s responsible gaming framework in
2022.

In June, Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed a bill to create a
responsible gaming grant program overseen by the
Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission as well as
the Behavioral Health Administration within the state’s
Department of Human Services. Under the program, an
initial $2.5 million was made available to fund problem
gambling services and programs across the state through
applications submitted for the review by the two state
agencies. Additional funding for the grant program will be
subject to future appropriations by the state legislature.

Another provision of the bill required the Colorado Division
of Gaming to establish statewide self-exclusion registers
for land-based casino gaming and online sports wagering.

In December, the Limited Gaming Control Commission
then adopted formal regulations to implement statewide
self-exclusion and mandate additional responsible gaming
requirements for casino and sports betting operators.

Among other things, the new regulations will require casino
and sports betting operators to submit an annual strategic

implementation plan around their responsible gaming
programs. Plans should include information regarding
staffing levels, tools available to players, as well as details
of how operators plan to use player data and technology
to aid in identifying potential problem gamblers through
automated triggers based on patron activity.

Sports Betting
Another provision of the gaming bill signed into law by Gov.
Polis in June made changes to the tax regime applicable to
sports betting.

As a result of the new legislation, effective January 2023,
sports betting operators will no longer be permitted to
deduct an unlimited amount of promotional credits, free
bets and bonuses from their taxable revenue in Colorado.
Instead, operators may deduct no more than the equivalent
of 2.5 percent of total wagering handle through June
2024, with permitted deductions being further reduced
each year until they are capped at 1.75 percent of handle
from July 2026.

COLORADO: COMMERCIAL GAMING REVENUE BY SOURCE
2011 to 2022

Colorado continued its emergence as a major sports
betting market in 2022, with mobile and land-based sports
wagering accounting for almost 29 percent of overall
statewide commercial casino gaming revenue.

Sports Betting

In a separate policy change related to sports betting, the
Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission adopted
new regulations in March to permit sportsbook operators
to offer fixed-odds wagers on horse or greyhound races
subject to approval by the Colorado Racing Commission
and other parties. The new regulations also clarified the
regulatory process for approving new sports wagering
events in general.

Regulatory Reform
Also in June, Gov. Polis signed a separate gaming-related
bill to make several amendments to state laws applicable
to commercial casino gaming.

Among other things, the legislation granted the Colorado
Limited Gaming Control Commission broader authority to
combat illegal gambling at unlicensed establishments that
offer unregulated electronic gaming devices in any part of
the state. Previously, the commission’s regulatory authority
was restricted to the three Colorado towns authorized to
host commercial casino gaming.

Further regulatory changes introduced by the legislation
included reducing the minimum age requirement to work in
a Colorado commercial casino from 21 to 18, and granting
the gaming commission authority to waive a fingerprinting
requirement in the case of license applications submitted
by international sports betting companies.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from iGaming in Connecticut is taxed at a rate
of 18 percent, while revenue from online and land-based
sports betting is taxed at 13.75 percent. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, iGaming and sports betting generated total tax
revenue of approximately $55.1 million, a more than five-
fold increase from the previous year.

All tax revenue generated by iGaming and commercial
sports betting is deposited in Connecticut’s General Fund
and then redistributed to various state programs including
education, infrastructural investments, policing and
emergency services in accordance with the state’s annual
budget approved by lawmakers.

Competitive Landscape
Connecticut’s wider gaming market is dominated by the
Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods tribal casino-resorts operated
by the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot sovereign tribal
nations on their reservation lands. The two tribal casino-
resorts, both among the largest in the United States,
opened in the mid-1990s and were expanded in 2021 to
include retail sportsbook operations in accordance with
amendments to the two tribes’ gaming compacts.

SELECTED STATES: COMMERCIAL SPORTSBOOK GGR
2022

While Connecticut remains the only state in New England
with iGaming, regional competition for sports betting is
increasingly fierce. Following approval of a new law in
Massachusetts in 2022, each of Connecticut’s bordering
states has legalized both retail and mobile sports wagering.
Historically, both New York and Massachusetts have been
important feeder markets for tribal gaming in Connecticut.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming
In May, Gov. Ned Lamont (D) signed a bill to legally protect
the anonymity of players registering for self-exclusion from
online sports betting or iGaming in Connecticut.

Under prior state law, participants in the Connecticut
Lottery Corporation’s self-exclusion programs were exempt
from disclosure under the state’s Freedom of Information
Act that generally applies to government agencies. The
new legislation made a technical amendment to extend
those same exemptions to self-excluded players enrolling
via Connecticut’s two tribal nations, their sports betting
and iGaming partners, or the sports wagering partner of
the Connecticut Lottery.

The bill further authorized the Connecticut Lottery
Corporation to accept deposits via prepaid cards bought
from a traditional lottery retailer, in order to fund player
accounts for online keno and lottery draw games.

In 2022, Connecticut reported total commercial sports betting revenue of $135.5 million, with almost 93 percent of that total
being generated by mobile sports wagering platforms affiliated with the state’s two Native American tribes and the Connecticut
Lottery Corporation.

In addition to directly operating sports wagering, the DC Lottery regulates
privately-operated sports betting operations via the city’s Office of Lottery and

District of Columbia

The decline came despite expansion of the district’s
sports wagering market to two additional retail sports
betting locations, including the opening in June of a
FanDuel-branded sportsbook at DC United’s Audi Field
soccer stadium. The District of Columbia’s sports betting
operations also faced increased out-of-state competition
from sportsbooks at Maryland land-based casinos,
including at MGM National Harbor barely two miles beyond
city limits. Mobile sports betting was also launched in
Maryland in November.

The District of Columbia is an idiosyncratic market, with
a majority of revenue—around 65 percent—coming from
land-based or on-site sports betting operations, as opposed
to mobile sports wagering. Commercial sports betting
operators reported combined revenue of approximately
$15.0 million in 2022, down 22.1 percent on the prior year.
In contrast, the DC Lottery’s GambetDC program reported
annual revenue of $8.2 million, up 7.6 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from privately-operated sports betting in the
District of Columbia is taxed at a rate of 10 percent.
Private sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

DC Lottery-operated sports betting is not subject to
taxation per se; instead, the lottery returns all net revenue
after operating expenses to the city’s General Fund.

In 2022, commercial and lottery-operated sports betting
operations generated total tax revenue of approximately
$5.6 million, down 1.8 percent versus the previous year.

Under city law, the first $200,000 in total tax revenue
generated by privately-operated sports betting is dedicated
to problem gambling services in the District of Columbia,
with the remainder split evenly between two city funds
that support early childhood education and community
engagement initiatives. All profits generated by the DC
Lottery are transferred to the District of Columbia’s
General Fund.

Competitive Landscape
Sports betting operators in the District of Columbia face
significant and expanding regional competition.

Retail sportsbook locations in the city compete with
those at Maryland’s land-based casinos, racing facilities
and charitable gaming venues. At least one additional
sportsbook at Maryland sports arenas, including the
Washington Commanders’ home stadium FedEx Field, is
also pending.

Competition in the form of mobile sports betting comes
from sportsbook platforms licensed to operate in Virginia
and—as of November 2022—in Maryland.

Within the city, hundreds of licensed bars and restaurants
are eligible to apply for so-called Class B licenses to
operate on-premises sports betting. Although just two
Class B sportsbooks were open as of the end of 2022,
several additional locations have announced plans to enter
the market.

In addition to sports betting, the District of Columbia
also offers traditional and online lottery games via the
DC Lottery, charitable gaming, and electronic gaming
devices that purport to be based on player skill which are
permitted in bars and other licensed establishments.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In October, four District of Columbia council members
introduced a bill to amend the city’s 2019 sports wagering
act and enable commercial operators to offer mobile sports
betting throughout the district in competition with the DC
Lottery.

Under the bill, additional licenses would be made available
for citywide mobile sports wagering, subject to a $1 million
upfront fee and higher tax rate of 15 percent of revenue.

After being heard in one council committee in December,
however, the bill was not advanced for a vote before city
lawmakers adjourned for the year.

The legislation was filed after a series of oversight hearings
in which council members were critical of the performance
of the DC Lottery’s GambetDC sportsbook product. The
DC Office of Lottery and Gaming also held a series of
roundtable discussions in June to take stakeholder and
public input on potential regulatory changes for privately-
operated sports betting.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $491.8 million, up 1.8 percent from 2021

and the highest revenue total in more than a decade.

Market Overview
Delaware offers commercial casino gaming at three racinos, each of which
operate electronic gaming devices, table games, sports betting and iGaming
under the authority of the Delaware Lottery.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

GROSS CASINO GAMING REVENUE 2022
$491.8M

In 1994, the Delaware legislature approved the Horseracing Redevelopment
Act, which authorized racetracks to install electronic gaming devices. Table
games and limited sports betting (parlay wagers on professional football games)
were approved by the legislature in 2009 and 2010, respectively. IGaming was
approved in 2012.

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling ending federal prohibitions on expanded
sports wagering, Delaware racinos in June 2018 expanded their sports betting
operations to include a full range of single-game and proposition wagers on
all sports, not just football. Alongside full sportsbook operations at racinos,
the Delaware Lottery also offers football parlay cards at certain retail outlets,
including liquor and grocery stores.

of sports betting revenue is distributed to the local horse
racing industry.

In 2022, Delaware’s racinos and sports lottery retailers
generated total gaming tax revenue of approximately
$225.1 million, up 1.3 percent versus the previous year.

Of the total tax revenue generated by commercial gaming
operations in 2022, approximately $177 million was
returned to Delaware’s General Fund which is appropriated
annually for various purposes, including public and higher
education, health and social services and public safety. An
additional $48 million was allocated to Delaware’s racing
industry for the purpose of supplementing race purses.

Competitive Landscape
Delaware racinos compete in a crowded Mid-Atlantic
market that includes more than two-dozen commercial
casinos in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Delaware Park Casino, located near Wilmington,
directly competes for patrons in a Greater Philadelphia
market served by five casinos and racinos.

While Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada
to offer legal sports betting following the 2018 ruling of
the U.S. Supreme Court, sportsbook operations are now
available in each of its bordering states following the
launch of retail sports wagering at Maryland’s commercial
casinos in December 2021. Mobile sports betting was also
launched in Maryland in late 2022.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming
In April, Delaware, with Nevada and New Jersey,
announced that Michigan would join the Multi-State
Internet Gaming Association as the fourth member.

The association enables participating states to collaborate
in offering certain types of iGaming—specifically peer-to-
peer online poker games—on an interstate basis, in order
to offer larger player and prize pools.

Delaware and Nevada were the original states to sign the
Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement in 2014. New
Jersey became a member in 2017.

In contrast with the other forms of gaming, sports betting
revenue declined in 2022. Facing expanded out-of-state
competition from legal sportsbooks launched at Maryland
casinos, combined sports betting revenue from Delaware
racinos’ sports wagering operations and sports lottery
parlays was $17.3 million, a decline of 33.2 percent from
the previous year.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Delaware’s commercial casinos are subject to an effective
tax rate of approximately 56 percent on their gross revenue
from electronic gaming devices and a 20 percent tax on
their gross table game revenue, both inclusive of payments
used to subsidize race purses.

The effective taxation structure applied to iGaming
offerings is roughly the same as the structure applied to
the equivalent games in racinos. However, racinos are
entitled to a share of iGaming revenue only after the total
amount generated in any year surpasses $3.75 million.

Meanwhile, Delaware racinos retain approximately 40
percent of revenue from sports betting. The state keeps 50
percent of revenue but must pay additional commissions to
providers of the Delaware Lottery’s sports betting system
and risk-management services. Approximately 10 percent

Gaming Tax Distribution
Florida’s commercial casinos are taxed at a rate of 35
percent of electronic gaming device revenue.

In 2022, Florida commercial casinos generated total tax
revenue of $242.9 million, up 6.9 percent from the prior
year.

Under Florida law, all tax revenue from commercial casinos
is deposited into Florida’s Educational Enhancement
Trust Fund (EETF). The fund was established in 1986
to allocate annual revenue from the then-newly created
Florida Lottery for school districts, public colleges and
universities. Additional sums are also used to provide
financial aid to Florida students. Each year, the Florida
Legislature determines which programs are funded and at
what level under the EETF.

Competitive Landscape
Florida’s commercial casinos face significant competition
from the state’s seven tribal casinos, six of which are
owned and operated by the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
In addition to electronic gaming devices, the Seminole
casinos are eligible to offer blackjack and baccarat. In
2021, the tribe agreed a new compact with the state
enabling it offer roulette, craps, and both land-based and
online sports betting; however, that agreement has been
since been mired in federal court challenges.

Card rooms at Florida racetracks and jai alai frontons
outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties also offer
gaming, but are limited to the operation of non-banked
card games, such as poker.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Tribal Gaming
In December, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in the appeal of
the U.S. Department of Interior and the Seminole Tribe of
Florida to reinstate the landmark gaming compact inked by
the tribe and state of Florida in April 2021.

The owner of one of Florida’s commercial racinos
successfully argued before a lower court that the compact
was invalid since it authorized the Seminole Tribe to offer
mobile sports betting to players located throughout the
state and gaming would not be confined to Indian lands in
accordance with federal law. Other provisions of the 30-
year compact would allow the Seminole Tribe to develop
three new casino-resorts on its reservation land near Fort
Lauderdale and offer craps, roulette and sports betting in
its existing tribal casinos.

Lawyers for the federal government and the Seminole Tribe
argued that the Interior Department acted within its authority
when it allowed the compact to take effect in August 2021,
and that the agreement duly complies with the 1988 Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act which governs tribal gaming.

In a related development, the Interior Department’s
Bureau of Indian Affairs earlier in December proposed
updated regulations regarding the compacting process
for so-called Class III tribal casino gaming. Among other
things, the revised rules would expressly allow approval
of compacts, such as the 2021 agreement between the
Seminole Tribe and the state of Florida, which authorize
a tribe to conduct statewide mobile gaming via servers
located on reservation lands.

Expansion
In February, an effort to expand commercial casino gaming
to locations outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties
fell short when proponents were unable to gather a
sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the November
2022 statewide ballot.

The proposed initiative would have authorized existing pari-
mutuel racing facilities in counties throughout Florida to
be licensed to offer casino gaming, provided they agreed to
invest at least $250 million in developing a casino-resort
and were located a minimum of 130 miles away from any
of the Seminole Tribe’s casinos.

The ballot petition was supported by more than 814,000
Florida voters, but needed around 80,000 additional voter
signatures in order to qualify for a statewide referendum. A
separate voter petition to authorize statewide mobile sports
betting via commercial sportsbook operators also failed to
qualify for the ballot.

The independent agency, overseen by a four-member
commission, was created through legislation approved by
lawmakers alongside the new Seminole compact in 2021.
Previously, Florida’s commercial racinos were overseen by
a division within the state’s Department of Business and
Professional Regulation.

Regulatory Reform
In March, Florida’s commercial casino gaming industry
entered a new regulatory era when the newly established
Florida Gaming Control Commission held its first official
meeting.

Among the activities undertaken by the new commission
in 2022 were establishing annual and long-term regulatory
plans, hiring appropriate staff and developing a formal
memorandum of understanding with the Seminole Tribe
regarding the oversight of tribal gaming in Florida.

ILLINOIS

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue increased by 25.2 percent to $2.14 billion,

reflecting Illinois’ rise as a major sports betting market.

Market Overview
Illinois offers commercial casino gaming at 10 riverboat casinos and one land-
based casino under the regulation of the Illinois Gaming Board (IGB).

In 1990, the Illinois legislature approved the Riverboat Gambling Act, which
authorized the IGB to grant up to 10 riverboat casino licenses. A gaming law
passed in 2019 expanded the market by authorizing up to six new land-based
casinos in different areas of the state, including the City of Chicago, while also
permitting Illinois racetracks to apply for licenses to become racinos offering
electronic gaming devices and table games.

In addition, the 2019 law legalized sports wagering at existing and future
casinos and racinos, as well as at up to three off-track betting facilities affiliated
with racinos and at major sports arenas across the state.

Casinos and racetracks are also eligible to operate statewide mobile sports
betting. At the end of 2022, legal sports betting was available at 11 retail
sportsbook locations and via seven online platforms.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.14 billion,
up 25.2 percent from the previous year.

The overall revenue growth primarily reflected Illinois’ continued rise as a major
market for sports betting. Total statewide sports betting revenue in 2022 was

betting market in the U.S. in 2022, as it leapfrogged New
Jersey but both states were eclipsed by New York following
the launch of mobile sports wagering in the Empire State.

Thanks in part to the end of a previous regulatory
requirement for all player accounts to be registered in-
person at a land-based casino or racing facility, online
sports betting revenue increased by more than 52 percent
to $760.3 million. Land-based sports betting revenue was
$33.8 million, up 40.0 percent.

Total statewide revenue from traditional casino gaming was
also up in 2022, reflecting a first full year of electronic
gaming device operations at Illinois’ 11th casino property
in Rockford as well as the temporary suspension of casino
gaming in January 2021 due to the pandemic.

Electronic gaming devices in Illinois casinos generated
revenue of $1.01 billion. That total was up 13.4 percent
against 2021 but still lower than in the years prior to the
pandemic amid ongoing competitive pressures from video
gaming devices in bars and at other retail establishments.
Table game revenue at Illinois commercial casinos was
$338.7 million, up 14.1 percent. Illinois’ 11 commercial
casinos admitted some 9.1 million patrons during 2022,
versus 7.7 million the previous year.

Illinois applies a graduated tax to commercial casino
gaming revenue, ranging from 15 percent on electronic
gaming device revenue up to $25 million, to 50 percent
on revenue of more than $200 million. Casino table games
are taxed at 15 percent on revenue up to $25 million, and
then 20 percent on revenue exceeding that amount. Illinois
also imposes an admissions tax of $2 per patron at Bally’s
Quad Cities Casino and $3 at all other casinos.

Sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 17 percent on
wagers placed in Cook County, which includes Chicago,
and 15 percent in all other areas of the state. Future
land-based sports betting facilities within Chicago will be
subject to an additional city tax of 2 percent. Sportsbook
operations are also subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise
tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Illinois commercial casinos and sports
betting operators generated total gaming tax revenue of
approximately $495.2 million, up 23.6 percent against the
prior year.

Of that total, roughly $409.2 million was paid to the state
government with the majority of state tax revenue then
redistributed to specific state funds for education programs
and capital projects, among others. Approximately $76.5
million in gaming tax revenue was generated for local
governments that host casinos, with a further $8.4 million
provided to Cook County from local sports wagering taxes.

Competitive Landscape
The prolonged rollout of a sweeping gaming expansion law
enacted in June 2019 means the competitive landscape for
Illinois’ commercial casino industry remains in a state of flux.

At the end of 2022, only one of at least eight new casino
gaming facilities authorized under that law had begun
operations. That casino—Rockford Casino—was also
open only as a temporary facility, with a full casino-resort
property still under development. New casino properties in
the cities of Chicago, Danville and Waukegan and in Cook
and Williamson counties remain at different stages of the
development and licensing process but all are expected to
open in the coming years. Meanwhile, Illinois’ two active
racetracks have applied for licenses to offer electronic
gaming devices and table games at their facilities, also in
accordance with the 2019 law.

Prior to the 2019 legislation, the primary competitive
challenge to Illinois’ commercial casino gaming industry
had come from the rollout of electronic gaming devices—
or video gaming terminals (VGTs)—in bars, restaurants,
truck stops and other retail establishments, as authorized
under a 2009 state law.

In 2022, Illinois’ network of more than 45,000 VGTs in
some 8,226 establishments generated total revenue of
$2.71 billion, up 9.5 percent versus the prior year.

In addition to the in-state competition, Illinois commercial
casinos in the Greater Chicago and East St. Louis
markets also compete directly with gaming properties in
northwestern Indiana and eastern Missouri, respectively.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
Development of a major new casino-resort in Chicago took
several steps forward in 2022.

In May, the Chicago City Council approved a Bally’s
Corporation proposal to build a $1.7 billion casino project
at the site of the printing plant of the Chicago Tribune
newspaper.

That proposal had previously been selected by Mayor Lori
Lightfoot to be Chicago’s chosen casino development
partner after a competitive request-for-proposals process.
Additional city council approval was required in order to
execute a formal host community agreement.

Bally’s submitted a formal casino license application to
the Illinois Gaming Board in August, while the Chicago City
Council granted various zoning approvals for the casino
development in December.

A Chicago casino-resort was arguably the headline act
of Illinois’ sweeping 2019 gaming expansion law. Once
licensed, Bally’s will be permitted to operate up to
4,000 electronic gaming devices and table games at the
Chicago casino location as well as at the city’s two major
international airports.

In October, the Illinois Gaming Board reopened an
application process to award up to three mobile-only
sports wagering licenses available under the state’s 2019
gaming expansion law. An initial licensing process was
abandoned when the lone qualified applicant to step
forward withdrew due to capital market conditions.

The three mobile sports wagering licenses require an
upfront fee of $20 million and were initially supposed
to coincide with an expansion of online sports betting in
Illinois to include remote registration of player accounts.
That planned competitive landscape shifted during the
pandemic, however, as online betting platforms affiliated
with Illinois casinos and racing facilities were permitted
to offer remote registration on a temporary basis for
public health reasons. Remote registration then became
permanently available in March 2022, when statutory
amendments passed in 2021 went into effect.

Regulatory Reform
In December, the Illinois Gaming Board published a series
of draft amendments to modernize the state’s casino
gaming regulations.

Among other things, the draft regulatory amendments
would require commercial casinos to install metal
detectors to prevent firearms on casino gaming floors.
Casino security requirements would also be updated to
reflect digital surveillance recording.

The updated regulations will take effect once published
in the state register and undergoing Illinois’ formal
rulemaking process.

INDIANA

In 2022, statewide commercial gaming revenue

reached a record total of $2.89 billion, up 6.1 percent,

reflecting the continued growth of Indiana’s sports

betting market as well as improvements in both

electronic gaming device and table game revenue.

Market Overview
Indiana offers commercial casino gaming at six riverboat casinos, four land-
based casinos and two racinos, each of which operates electronic gaming
devices, table games and sports betting. All 12 commercial casinos are
regulated by the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC).

In 1993, the Indiana legislature approved the Riverboat Gambling Act, which
authorized the IGC to grant up to 10 casino licenses. Legislation authorizing an
11th commercial casino within a “historic hotel district” was approved in 2003,
paving the way for the opening of French Lick Resort Casino.

The state legislature in 2007 authorized the installation of up to 2,000
electronic gaming devices at each of Indiana’s two racetracks. Under legislation
passed in 2015 and later amended in 2019, racetracks were also approved to
install live-dealer table games.

In 2019, a bill passed by the legislature authorized sports betting at commercial
casinos and racinos, as well as at off-track betting facilities affiliated with
racinos. Casinos and racinos are also permitted to deploy online sports betting
through a maximum of three platforms operating under their licenses. At the
end of 2022, Indiana’s online sports betting market was served by 14 digital
sportsbook platforms.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.89 billion,
up 6.1 percent against 2021.

The revenue total was a record for the state, with each
segment of Indiana’s commercial gaming industry
reporting year-over-year growth.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices in
2022 was $2.02 billion, up 2.2 percent versus the prior
year, while revenue from table games was $479.0 million,
up 10.1 percent.

Statewide sports betting revenue amounted to $386.9
million, an increase of 25.5 percent over the previous year.
Online sports betting accounted for approximately 89.8
percent of the revenue total.

Indiana applies a graduated tax to electronic gaming
devices and table games at riverboat and land-based
casinos, ranging from 15 percent on gaming revenue of up
to $25 million, to 40 percent on gaming revenue of more
than $600 million.

Riverboat and land-based casinos are also subject to a
supplemental wagering tax, which is capped at a maximum
of 3.5 percent of total gaming revenue.

Racinos are taxed at a rate of 25 percent of revenue up
to $100 million; 30 percent on revenue between $100
million to $200 million; and 35 percent on revenue
exceeding $200 million.

Meanwhile, land-based and online sports betting operated
by casinos, racinos and their affiliated online platforms
is taxed at a headline rate of 9.5 percent of revenue.
Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Indiana saw total commercial casino gaming tax
revenue of approximately $688.3 million, up 5.1 percent
against the previous year.

Pursuant to state law, the majority of gaming tax revenue
is held in Indiana’s General Fund and used for general
state budgetary purposes. Additional allocations are made
to Indiana’s horse racing industry, problem gambling
services, and to local city and county governments, among
other things.

Competitive Landscape
Indiana is set to welcome a 13th commercial casino
property in early 2024, when a land-based casino licensed
in the city of Terre Haute is scheduled to open. The casino
was authorized under a 2019 law that allowed for one
casino license in northwestern Indiana to be relocated
to a location in Vigo County, on the state’s border with
Illinois. Local voters approved a casino in a November
2019 referendum and the Indiana Gaming Commission
eventually awarded a license for the project in late 2021.

Commercial casinos in northern Indiana compete with
one tribal casino in the city of South Bend that offers a
full range of electronic gaming devices, table games and
sports betting, having previously been limited to electronic
bingo games.

Thanks to a 2019 Illinois gaming expansion law,
northwestern Indiana casinos that already compete with
various Illinois casinos located in the Greater Chicago
area face the prospect of several new casinos that will
be located within the City of Chicago, as well as in Cook
County to the city’s south and Waukegan to Chicago’s
north.

Elsewhere, riverboat casinos in southeastern Indiana
compete with a trio of Ohio casinos and racinos serving
the Greater Cincinnati market. Casinos in southeastern
and southern Indiana also face growing competition from
the expansion of historical horse racing devices at racing
venues in Kentucky.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming
In September, the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC)
published an independent report regarding the prospective
authorization of iGaming in the state.

The IGC commissioned the study in February in order to
provide an independent forecast on the potential gaming
revenue and economic impact of a legal iGaming market
in Indiana, as well as various policy questions for state
lawmakers to consider.

A MERI C A N G A MIN G A S S O CIATIO N

S TATE O F THE S TATE S 202 3

Indiana

The published report projected that Indiana would
generate an estimated $836 million in iGaming revenue
by year three of operation, yielding around $164 million
to $376 million in state tax revenue depending on the tax
rate applied through state legislation. The report further
concluded that evidence from the six states with lawful
internet casino gaming suggested that Indiana’s land-
based commercial casinos would see little, if any, negative
impact in terms of cannibalization of their traditional
gaming revenue.

Legislation to authorize internet casino gaming via
Indiana’s land-based commercial casinos and affiliated
online casino platforms was introduced in the Indiana
House in January but died the following month without
receiving a committee hearing. Supporters of iGaming in
the state legislature said they would reintroduce proposals
for consideration in the 2023 session.

IOWA

Fueled by the continued growth of Iowa’s online sports

betting market, total statewide commercial gaming

revenue reached a record total of $1.93 billion in 2022.

Market Overview
Iowa offers commercial casino gaming at 15 land-based casinos, three riverboat
casinos and one racino. The 19 properties, all of which operate electronic
gaming devices, table games and sports betting, are regulated by the Iowa
Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC).

In 1989, Iowa became the first state to legalize riverboat casinos with the
passage of the Excursion Gambling Boat Act. Electronic gaming devices at
racetracks were authorized in 1994, with table games approved in 2005. A
2019 law allows Iowa’s commercial casinos and racinos to offer land-based and
online sports betting. At the conclusion of 2022, sports betting was available at
each of Iowa’s 19 commercial casino locations as well as through a total of 18
affiliated mobile sports wagering platforms.

There are no statutory limits on the number of commercial casinos that may
operate in Iowa. However, counties seeking to host a casino or racino must
secure the approval of a majority of its residents via a county-wide referendum.
A second voter referendum is required eight years after initial approval.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$1.93 billion, up 3.7 percent versus the previous year.

Revenue from electronic gaming devices was $1.59 billion, up 0.7 percent
versus 2021, while revenue from table games was $178.8 million, up 4.0
percent.

In 2022, Iowa’s commercial casino and sports betting
operations generated total gaming tax revenue of $393.2
million, up 0.6 percent from the prior year.

Of that amount, approximately $362.1 million was
received by the state and reallocated to various
beneficiaries, including the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure
Fund and Iowa Skilled Worker & Job Creation Fund. A
further $17.2 million was allocated to city and county
governments that host casinos, while $13.8 million went to
community foundations in counties without casinos.

Competitive Landscape
Iowa’s commercial casinos compete with four tribal casinos
located within the state’s borders as well as with various
commercial and tribal casinos located in neighboring
South Dakota, Nebraska and Missouri.

Cross-border competition intensified in 2022 with the
opening of Nebraska’s first commercial casino locations,
and forthcoming racinos in Omaha and South Sioux City
are poised to compete directly with Iowa casinos in Council
Bluffs and Sioux City, respectively.

Casinos in eastern Iowa also face competition from
electronic gaming devices (VGTs) in Illinois bars and other
retail venues.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
After voters in Linn County passed a second referendum
in November 2021 to grant local approval for a potential
casino in the city of Cedar Rapids, state lawmakers acted
in 2022 to forestall any discussion of a 20th commercial
gaming property in Iowa.

In June, Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed a bill preventing
the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission from issuing any
additional casino licenses until at least June 1, 2024. The
moratorium would not apply to an existing casino seeking
to move to a new location within the same county.

The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission twice voted to
deny a new casino in Cedar Rapids in 2014 and 2017,
citing concerns of market saturation. Regulators had
been prepared to revisit the issue in 2022, however, after
receiving new market studies as to the impact of a new
casino on the state’s gaming industry.

Payments Modernization
The legal provisions imposing a moratorium on new casino
licenses were enacted as part of a wider gaming reform bill
passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Gov.
Reynolds.

The bill also cleared the way for cashless wagering on
the gaming floors of Iowa commercial casinos, clarifying
that statutory prohibitions related to the dispensing of
cash or credit in casinos would not apply to a cashless
wagering system that was being accessed through a mobile
application operated by the casino.

The bill also amended Iowa’s sports wagering law to permit
operators to offer bets on “sports-related events,” such
as the outcome of pro sports drafts or individual player
awards, that are not directly determined on the field of
play. Prior to the statutory change, Iowa regulators had
determined that such wagering events were not permissible
under state law.

As initially passed by the Iowa House, the gaming reform
bill signed in June also would have authorized wagering
on esports contests. Provisions related to esports were
removed from the legislation in the Senate, however.

KANSAS

The addition of legal sports betting to Kansas’

commercial gaming market led to record revenue of

$478.1 million in 2022, up 18.5 percent versus the

prior year.

Market Overview
Kansas offers commercial casino gaming at four state-owned casinos, which
are developed and managed by private companies. The casinos, which are
permitted to offer electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting,
are operated under the constitutional authority of the Kansas Lottery and are
regulated by the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission (KRGC).

In 2007, the legislature approved the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, which
authorized the creation of four “lottery gaming facilities,” one in each of the
four designated gaming zones throughout the state. The four casinos opened
between 2009 and 2017.

In 2022, lawmakers approved legislation authorizing Kansas’ commercial
casinos to operate sports betting via land-based sportsbooks within their casino
properties, through kiosks installed at partnering retail locations, as well as
through a maximum of three branded mobile platforms for each casino. Land-
based and online sports betting went live at three of the four casinos and via six
mobile sportsbook platforms in September.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $478.1
million, up 18.5 percent from the previous year.

The record total reflected the addition of legal sports betting to Kansas’
commercial gaming market. After launching in early September, online and
land-based sportsbooks reported total gross sports wagering revenue of $76.5

$3.1 million of that total was generated by Kansas’ six
initial mobile sports betting platforms.

Without sports betting, Kansas’ commercial casino gaming
market would have reported a modest decline in revenue
for 2022.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices
was $352.4 million, down 3.1 percent from 2021,
although table game revenue increased by some 23.4
percent to $49.1 million.

While three of Kansas’ four commercial casinos reported
an increase in traditional electronic gaming device and
table game revenue, that was not the case at Kansas Star
Casino, the state’s largest.

The casino, which is located just south of Wichita, has
suffered from expanded competition since the opening of
a new tribal casino in 2021 some 25 miles away to the
north of the city. In 2022, Kansas Star Casino reported
total casino gaming revenue of $159.5 million, down

gaming revenue, which includes a minimum 22 percent
contribution to the state, 3 percent to local governments,
and 2 percent to fund problem gambling treatment.
Casinos’ management contracts also include provisions
allowing for higher tax rates to be applied if revenue
exceeds a certain threshold during a calendar year.

In 2022, Kansas’ commercial casinos generated total tax
revenue from electronic gaming devices and table games
of $108.4 million, down 0.5 percent from the previous
year. Of this total amount, approximately $88.3 million
was received by the state, $12.0 million was allocated to
local governments that host casinos, and $8.0 million was
generated to fund problem gambling services.

Per Kansas law, the state portion of casino gaming tax
revenue is distributed to the state’s Expanded Lottery
Act Revenues Fund. Appropriations from the fund are
determined annually at the direction of the state legislature
but must be allocated to specific causes that include state
debt reduction, covering public employees’ retirement
liabilities, and an initiative to increase the number of
engineering graduates at Kansas universities.

A further $2.1 million in gaming tax revenue was raised
in 2022 from newly launched sports betting operations.
Under Kansas’ 2022 sports wagering law, all tax revenue
is deposited into the state’s Sports Wagering Fund and
redistributed for specific purposes, including prosecuting
illegal gambling and incentivizing professional sports
teams to relocate to the state.

Competitive Landscape
In addition to its four commercial casinos, Kansas hosts
seven tribal casinos on Indian reservation lands within the
state. Tribal casinos located in the northeastern corner
of the state compete with Hollywood Casino at Kansas
Speedway located just outside of Kansas City. Hollywood
Casino also competes directly with four casinos on the
Missouri side of the Kansas–Missouri border.

Kansas Crossing Casino in southeastern Kansas competes
with several tribal casinos in northeastern Oklahoma,
while Kansas Star Casino competes directly with a tribal
casino in Sedgwick County, near Wichita. As a result of
legislation passed in 2022, Kansas Star Crossing faces
the prospect of additional future competition in the shape
of electronic gaming devices that may now be sited at a
former greyhound track in Sedgwick County.

The legislation enabled Kansas’ four commercial casinos
to operate land-based sportsbooks in their properties
as well as mobile sports betting via a maximum of three
affiliated mobile platforms—or “skins”. Casinos were
also authorized to partner with up to 50 retail locations,
including professional sports stadiums, to host sports
wagering kiosks in their facilities. A minimum of 20
percent of partnering retail locations must be either
veterans halls or fraternal organizations.

Regulations to implement the sports wagering law were
adopted by the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission
and the Kansas Lottery in August, and both land-based
and online sports betting launched in time for the kickoff
of the new National Football League season in September.

Kansas was one of three states to pass legislation to
authorize sports betting in 2022, along with Maine and
Massachusetts.

Expansion
Alongside sports betting, the legislation signed by Gov.
Kelly in May included additional provisions to allow for
electronic gaming devices based on historical horse races
at the shuttered Wichita Greyhound Park racetrack in
Sedgwick County.

Under the new law, up to 1,000 historical horse racing
devices would be permitted at a reopened racing facility.
As of the end of 2022, litigation related to the machines
and their potential conflict with the casino management
contract signed by Kansas Star Casino in the same region
of the state was ongoing.

A further provision of the sports wagering bill also granted
the KRGC and state attorney general express authority to

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $2.59 billion, up 8.9 percent against the

previous year and reflecting the launch of mobile sports

betting in 55 of Louisiana’s 64 parishes in January.

Market Overview
Louisiana offers commercial casino gaming at 14 riverboat casinos and one
land-based casino, each of which operates electronic gaming devices and table
games. Four racinos—limited to offering electronic gaming devices—are also
operational. All 19 properties are regulated by the Louisiana Gaming Control
Board (LGCB).

Commercial casino gaming was first authorized in 1991 when the Louisiana
legislature passed a law allowing a maximum of 15 riverboat casinos, either
sailing or permanently moored on specific waterways in different areas of the
state. The following year, legislation passed authorizing a single land-based
casino in downtown New Orleans. Racinos were approved by the legislature in
1997.

In 2020, voters in 55 of 64 Louisiana parishes approved a referendum on
sports betting. Legislation to implement that referendum was then passed
in 2021. Land-based sports betting was launched in Louisiana commercial
casinos and racinos in October 2021, with online sportsbook operations
launching in January 2022.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.59 billion,
up 8.9 percent versus the previous year and reflecting the first full-year with
legal sports betting in Louisiana.

Louisiana

Revenue from traditional electronic gaming devices and
table games at Louisiana casinos and racinos increased by
a modest 0.3 percent to $2.38 billion.

Total statewide sports betting revenue reached $214.5
million, compared with just $10.1 million in revenue
in 2021, though that figure was from fewer than three
months of land-based sportsbook operations. After
launching in mid-January 2022, mobile sports wagering
generated $180.4 million in revenue—or approximately 84
percent of the statewide total.

Racino revenue is taxed at an effective rate of about 36
percent. That rate comprises an 18 percent contribution
to the Louisiana horse racing industry taken off the top,
with the remaining revenue subject to a state tax of 18.5
percent and local taxes of 4 percent.

The New Orleans land-based casino pays the greater of
either a 21.5 percent tax on gaming revenue or an annual
fee of $60 million. The land-based casino must also remit
rent and various other payments to local authorities, as
established under its operating contract.

Growth in the Louisiana casino gaming market was not
spread evenly across all regions of the state. Whereas total
casino revenue increased in the Lake Charles and New
Orleans markets, revenue was down year-over-year in the
Shreveport/Bossier and Baton Rouge regions.

Meanwhile, sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 10
percent in the case of land-based sports wagering and 15
percent for online sports betting. Sportsbook operations
are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from each type of commercial casino
establishment in Louisiana—riverboat casinos, racinos
and the New Orleans land-based casino—is subject to a
different tax structure.

Riverboat casinos pay a maximum effective tax rate of
27.5 percent, comprising a state gaming tax of 21.5
percent of revenue plus additional local taxes which vary
according to location.

In 2022, Louisiana’s commercial casino, racino and sports
betting operations generated total gaming tax revenue of
approximately $601.1 million, up 4.9 percent from the
previous year.

In accordance with state law, the majority of gaming
tax revenue is remitted to Louisiana’s General Fund.
From there, finds are appropriated at the direction of the
legislature and used to pay for public education, public
retirement systems, highway construction, and fire and
police protection, among other things.

In addition, the state’s horse racing industry received
approximately $58.3 million in 2022 from taxes on
racinos’ revenue from electronic gaming devices.

Competitive Landscape
Louisiana’s commercial casinos and racinos compete
with five tribal casinos scattered throughout the state
which offer a full range of casino gaming, including sports
betting. There are also nearly 12,200 electronic gaming
devices offered in Louisiana at more than 1,400 non-
casino locations, such as bars, restaurants, truck stops
and off-track betting parlors. In 2022, total statewide
revenue from electronic gaming devices in non-casino
locations was $809.9 million, down 3.5 percent from the
previous year.

Casinos in southeastern Louisiana compete directly with
commercial casinos in the Gulf Coast region of neighboring
Mississippi that have historically drawn a significant
proportion of their patrons from across the border.

Properties in the Lake Charles and Shreveport/Bossier
regions have traditionally competed with tribal casinos
in Oklahoma to attract players from Texas, meaning they
would be vulnerable to losing patrons should lawmakers
in the Lone Star State approve a bill to authorize casino-
resorts during Texas’ 2023 biennial legislative session.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
Louisiana officials made several changes to state law and
regulations in 2022 in order to integrate sports betting
within the state’s commercial gaming framework.

One month after the launch of mobile sports betting, the
Louisiana Gaming Control Board in February approved
new regulations clarifying operators’ responsibilities in
various areas, including responsible gaming and the state’s
self-exclusion program, geolocation, and disclosures in
advertising. Among other things, the regulations required
online sports betting platforms to identify the Louisiana
casino or racino with which they are affiliated on all
advertising, marketing and public relations materials.

In June, Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill making
several technical amendments to Louisiana’s 2021 sports
betting statute. Among other things, those amendments
addressed privacy issues related to self-exclusion, the
tax treatment of promotional credits for sports wagering,

and the distribution of certain tax proceeds across the 55
Louisiana parishes that permit sports wagering.

Gov. Edwards signed two other bills into law the same
month, one allowing mobile sports betting accounts to
be considered legally abandoned after three years of no
patron activity, the other permitting pari-mutuel wagering
on horse races to be offered in the sportsbooks of
Louisiana casinos and racinos, subject to approval by the
Louisiana State Racing Commission.

Pandemic Relief
In May, Gov. Edwards signed a bill granting the Harrah’s
New Orleans land-based casino temporary relief from
certain provisions of a state law that governs the terms of a
city management contract for the casino.

Specifically, the bill suspended a statutory requirement
for the casino to maintain a workforce of at least 90
percent the level as of March 2001. The temporary relief is
effective until June 2024.

MAINE

Maine commercial casino gaming revenue reached

a record total of $165.1 million in 2022, a year that

also saw the passage of legislation to authorize sports

wagering in the state.

Market Overview
Maine offers commercial casino gaming at one land-based casino-resort and
one racino. Both properties offer electronic gaming devices and table games
and are subject to oversight by the Maine Gambling Control Board and Gambling
Control Unit.

Commercial casino gaming was first authorized in 2003 after voters approved a
statewide referendum allowing electronic gaming devices at Bangor Raceway—
what is now Hollywood Casino Bangor. In 2011, Hollywood Casino received
approval to add table games. Maine’s second casino, located in Oxford County,
was authorized via a separate voter referendum held in 2010.

Under Maine’s regulatory framework, a maximum of two commercial casino
gaming facilities may be operated after approval in a local referendum. There
is also a statewide cap of 3,000 electronic gaming devices, with the allocation
split evenly between the two properties.

Under legislation approved in 2022, Maine’s two commercial casinos and
licensed racing simulcast facilities are also authorized to offer retail sports
betting. Regulations to implement that new state law had yet to be adopted by
the end of the year, however.

Market Performance
In 2022, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue reached a record total of
$165.1 million, an increase of 12.4 percent from the prior year.

Helping comparisons: for the first two months of 2021,
casinos were able to accommodate no more than 200
guests at a time due to operating restrictions put in place
to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. No such restrictions
were in place during 2022.

Electronic gaming devices at Maine’s two commercial casino
properties generated a total of $139.8 million in revenue in
2022, up 10.3 percent relative to the previous year. Table
game revenue was $25.2 million, up 25.3 percent.

Oxford Casino solidified its position as the more lucrative
of Maine’s two commercial casinos in 2022. Oxford Casino
generated total gaming revenue of approximately $107.8
million, up 15.6 percent versus the prior year. Hollywood
Casino Bangor meanwhile reported $57.2 million in
revenue, up 6.3 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Maine’s two commercial casinos are subject to different
tax rates. Hollywood Casino, as a racino property, pays 39
percent of electronic gaming device revenue and 1 percent
of electronic gaming device handle in taxes. Oxford Casino,
as a standalone casino, is subject to a tax rate of 46
percent of electronic gaming device revenue. Both casinos
pay 16 percent of their table game revenue in taxes.

In 2022, Maine’s commercial casinos generated total
gaming tax revenue of $68.2 million, up 11.4 percent from
the previous year.

The biggest recipients of gaming tax dollars in Maine
are the state’s Department of Education to support K-12
school programs, scholarship programs to state and
community colleges, and a state fund established in 2000
to provide prevention-related services and other healthcare
programs for Maine families. Gaming tax revenue is also
distributed to support the state’s horse racing industry,
agricultural programs and the local governments that host
commercial casinos.

Competitive Landscape
Maine’s commercial casinos operate at the outer edge of a
New England market that includes commercial and tribal
casino-resorts in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.

Following the opening of Encore Boston Harbor in
Massachusetts in 2019 there is limited new regional
competition on the horizon in terms of casino-resorts.
However electronic gaming devices based on historical
horse races became operational at charitable gaming
locations in New Hampshire in 2022, in line with
legislation approved the previous year.

Maine’s wider gaming market also includes six racing and
off-track betting facilities. While these locations do not
currently offer any form of casino gaming, they will be
eligible to offer sports wagering alongside the state’s two
casinos, in accordance with legislation approved by Maine
lawmakers in 2022.

Similarly, Maine is home to four federally recognized Indian
tribes that do not operate casino gaming on Indian lands.
While there have been several failed attempts by the state
legislature to authorize tribal gaming, Maine’s Indian tribes
will be eligible in future to operate statewide mobile sports
wagering.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In May, Gov. Janet Mills (D) signed into law a bill to
authorize land-based and online sports betting in Maine.

Under the legislation, mobile sports betting may be
operated exclusively by Maine’s federally recognized Indian
tribes. Tribes will be able to outsource the operation of
their online sportsbook platforms, but would still have to
retain a significant portion of the overall revenue.

Retail sports betting will be permitted at Maine’s two
commercial casino locations as well as at licensed
racetracks and off-track betting facilities.

At the conclusion of 2022, implementing regulations
for sports wagering were still to be drafted by the Maine

Gambling Control Unit. Gov. Mills previously vetoed
a sports betting bill in 2020, citing concerns over a
proliferation of advertising and a desire for further study of
the issue.

Regulatory Reform
Maine gaming regulators initiated several reforms to the
state’s casino gaming regulations in 2022.

In November, the Maine Gambling Control Unit published
updated minimum internal control standards—or MICS—
applicable to commercial casinos. The updated standards
largely proposed technical amendments to Maine’s
existing MICS but did include new guidelines applicable to
electronic table games, among other things.

In August, the Maine Gambling Control Board also adopted
updated regulations applicable to the self-exclusion
programs offered by the state’s two commercial casinos.

Total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue hit a

record $2.20 billion in 2022, a year that saw the launch

of mobile sports wagering.

Market Overview
Maryland offers commercial casino gaming at five land-based casinos and
one racino, each of which is eligible to operate electronic gaming devices,
table games and sports betting. The casinos are regulated by the Maryland
Lottery and Gaming Control Agency and Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission.

Commercial casino gaming was first approved in 2008 when Maryland voters
passed a constitutional amendment allowing a total of five casinos limited to
electronic gaming devices. The market expanded in 2012 when lawmakers and
voters authorized table games at all casino properties as well as a license for a
sixth commercial casino in Prince George’s County, near Washington D.C.

Sports betting was approved by state voters in 2020 and authorized via a state
law enacted the following year. Land-based sports betting was launched at
Maryland commercial casinos in late 2021, followed by mobile sports betting in
November 2022.

Market Performance
Partly reflecting a first full-year of legal sports betting in Maryland, total
statewide commercial casino gaming revenue reached a record $2.20 billion in
2022, up 14.3 percent versus the prior year.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $1.33 billion, up 2.2
percent relative to 2021, while revenue from table games was $723.4 million,
up 16.1 percent.

Maryland

Full-year sports betting revenue amounted to $149.5
million, versus just $3.2 million from a few weeks of
operations in 2021. Despite not launching until the day
before Thanksgiving, mobile sports betting still accounted
for a majority of the annual total. In less than six weeks,
online sportsbooks generated $108.2 million in reported
gross revenue. Retail sportsbooks at Maryland casinos
generated approximately $41.2 million in revenue in 2022.

Notably, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County
generated more gaming revenue than any commercial
casino property outside of Nevada in 2022. The casino-
resort, located some 11 miles from downtown Washington
D.C. and a short drive from the populous northern Virginia
suburbs, generated approximately $895.7 million in
combined revenue from electronic gaming devices, table
games and retail sports betting in 2022, up 16.2 percent
from the previous year. Those totals allowed MGM National
Harbor to narrowly surpass the $891.7 million generated
by Resorts World New York in Queens.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Maryland’s commercial casinos pay some of the country’s
highest tax rates on proceeds from electronic gaming
devices—between 40 and 61 percent, depending on the
specific casino.

Table games are taxed at 20 percent. In addition to taxes
on revenue, casinos must pay an annual assessment of
$425 per electronic gaming device and $500 per table
game to help fund responsible gambling programs.

Meanwhile, sports betting revenue is taxed at a headline rate
of 15 percent. Sportsbook operations are also subject to a
0.25 percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Maryland’s commercial casino and sports betting
operations generated total gaming tax revenue of $854.7
million, up 5.0 percent from the previous year.

Of the gaming tax total, approximately $617.1 million
was distributed to Maryland’s Education Trust Fund,
which supports public education and construction of new
schools, including public colleges, throughout the state.
Approximately $108.3 million was distributed in the form
of local impact grants and other contributions to local
governments.

The remaining tax revenue generated by traditional
casino games supported the state’s horse racing industry,
responsible gaming initiatives and minority- or women-
owned businesses. In addition, some $6.1 million in
sports wagering tax revenue was deposited into Maryland’s
State Lottery Fund for the benefit of Baltimore City Public
Schools, veterans programs and sports facilities, among
other beneficiaries.

Competitive Landscape
Maryland’s six commercial casinos operate in a competitive
Mid-Atlantic region that includes properties in Delaware,
eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The state’s three
largest casinos—MGM National Harbor, Live! Casino
and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore—also compete directly
with Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, West Virginia, for
customers in the populous Baltimore–Washington D.C.
metro area.

In terms of sports betting, the MGM, Live! and Horseshoe
casinos also compete with a trio of retail sportsbook
facilities at Washington D.C.’s three major sports stadiums
and arenas. In addition, Maryland’s newly launched mobile
sports betting platforms face a degree of cross-border
competition for customers in the Greater Washington
D.C. area from mobile sportsbooks licensed to operate in
Virginia, as well as from the D.C. Lottery’s mobile platform.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
The expansion of Maryland’s sports betting market was top
of the agenda for state gaming regulators and policymakers
in 2022.

In September, Maryland’s independent Sports Wagering
Application Review Commission opened a competitive
process to award up to 60 mobile sports wagering licenses
and up to 30 additional retail licenses that were authorized
by a 2021 state law. The state’s six commercial casinos
were among 17 named locations that were automatically
entitled to receive a retail sports betting license, subject to
regulatory approval.

The commission’s application criteria included one notable
requirement for all licensees to be at least 5 percent
owned by individuals with a personal net worth of less
than less than $1.8 million. The condition was included
following an evaluation by SWARC as to whether it could
set more specific race- or gender-based selection criteria
in line with a mandate from the state legislature to achieve
diversity in Maryland’s sports betting market. Successful
applicants were also required to submit formal diversity
plans for approval by regulators upon receiving a license.

In November, SWARC awarded 10 initial licenses for
mobile sports betting. Seven of those 10 licensees went

live in late November. Additional license applications
remained pending at the end of the year.

In a separate development related to the rollout of sports
wagering, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) signed legislation in June
to clarify minimum distance requirements between certain
land-based sports betting locations and to enable off-track
betting locations to operate kiosks offering wagers for both
horse races and non-equine sports, subject to certain
conditions.

Regulatory Reform
In November, the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission approved new technical and minimum internal
control standards applicable to commercial casino and
sports betting operators in the state.

Among other things, the amended standards clarified
state anti-money laundering reporting requirements to
ensure that both casinos and sports betting operators
provide a copy of reports to state gaming regulators after
first filing them with the federal government’s Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network. The revised standards also
amended previous provisions related to the geolocation of
sports wagers and lowered the minimum payout threshold
for electronic gaming devices in Maryland casinos from 87
to 85 percent.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was a record $1.13 billion, up 10.9 percent

from 2021. Additionally, Massachusetts lawmakers

approved legislation legalizing sports betting.

Market Overview
Massachusetts offers commercial casino gaming at two casino-resorts operating
electronic gaming devices and table games and at one racino, which is
restricted to electronic gaming devices.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

GROSS CASINO GAMING REVENUE 2022
$1.13B

Casino gaming was legalized in 2011 when the legislature passed a law
authorizing commercial gaming at three casino-resorts in different regions of
the state, plus an additional “Category 2” facility limited to electronic gaming
devices. The law also established the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to
issue licenses for the four properties and to regulate their operations.

Massachusetts’ Category 2 casino was opened alongside Plainridge Park, a
harness racing track in Plainville, in 2015. The MGM Springfield and Encore
Boston Harbor casino-resorts later opened in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

The license for Massachusetts’ fourth and final casino was designated under
the 2011 law for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to develop a tribal casino in
the southeastern region of the state. The Mashpee project has faced a series
of legal challenges, however, while the Massachusetts Gaming Commission has
so far declined to move forward with licensing an alternative commercial casino
project in the same region.

In 2022, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill to authorize sports
wagering at the state’s commercial casino and racing facilities as well as
through affiliated and standalone mobile sportsbook platforms. At the end of
the year, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission was still in the process of
adopting regulations and conducting licensing investigations in order to fully
implement the sports betting law.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial gaming revenue was
$1.13 billion. The record total represented an increase of
10.9 percent from the previous year.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was
$745.7 million, up 7.9 percent versus 2021. Table game
revenue was $386.2 million, up 17.1 percent.

Encore Boston Harbor continued its emergence as one
of the most lucrative commercial casino-resorts in North
America. The property in Everett, just north of Boston,
reported total gaming revenue of $729.7 million, an
increase of 15.0 percent on the prior year. That was
enough to make Encore Boston Harbor the third highest
grossing commercial casino outside of Nevada, behind only
MGM National Harbor in Maryland and Resorts World New
York in Queens.

MGM Springfield reported total revenue of $259.1 million,
up 4.9 percent against 2021, while Plainridge Park Casino
reported revenue of $143.1 million, up 2.7 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
When Massachusetts authorized commercial casino
gaming in 2011 it established different tax rates for its
Category 1 and Category 2 licensees.

Whereas Plainridge Park, which holds the Category 2
license, is subject to a 49 percent tax on electronic gaming
device revenue, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor
are subject to a lower rate of 25 percent of both electronic
gaming device and table game revenue. The lower overall
rate reflects, in part, the greater staff cost involved in the
hosting of live table games, as well as the larger amounts
Category 1 licensees were required to invest to develop
their casino-resorts. In addition to the taxes on revenue, all
commercial casino facilities must pay a $600 annual fee for
each of their electronic gaming devices.

In 2022, Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos
generated total gaming tax revenue of $317.3 million, up
9.9 percent from 2021.

Of this amount, approximately $107 million was
distributed to Massachusetts’ Gaming Local Aid Fund,
which was created under the 2011 gaming law to help
support the budgetary needs of city and town governments
across the state.

While the Gaming Local Aid Fund receives the largest slice
of casino-resort tax revenue, other major beneficiaries
include transportation and infrastructure projects, K–12
and higher education programs, and a statewide economic
development fund.

Finally, 18 percent of gaming tax revenue generated by
Plainridge Park is directed toward the Massachusetts horse
racing industry.

Competitive Landscape
Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos operate in
a fiercely competitive New England gaming market
that includes several large-scale commercial and tribal
casinos in neighboring Connecticut and Rhode Island that
have traditionally drawn a significant proportion of their
customers from the Bay State.

Additional in-state competition is also pending in the
shape of the Mashpee Wampanoag’s potential tribal
casino-resort on Indian lands in the city of Taunton,
some 20 miles from Plainridge Park Casino. A second
Massachusetts Indian tribe, the Wampanoag Tribe of
Gay Head (Aquinnah), is also developing a more modest
gaming facility limited to electronic bingo devices on the
island of Martha’s Vineyard.

Approval of legislation in both Massachusetts and Maine in
2022 means sports betting is now poised to become legal
in every state in the New England region, with the exception
of Vermont. Before the arrival of legal sports wagering,
Massachusetts residents had the option to place bets in
casinos, land-based sportsbooks or mobile platforms in
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In August, then-Gov. Charlie Baker (R) ended several years
of policy debate over sports wagering in Massachusetts by
signing a bill authorizing both online and land-based sports
betting across the state.

The law, approved by the House and Senate in the dying
minutes of the state’s 2021-22 legislative session,
authorized Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos and
racinos to open physical sportsbooks at their properties
and deploy up to two branded platforms—or “skins”—for
mobile sports betting.

Licensed racing facilities became eligible to apply for
licenses to operate land-based sports betting as well as
a single mobile sportsbook skin, while a total of seven
additional licenses were made available for standalone
mobile sports betting operations that would be unaffiliated
with any incumbent casino or racing facility.

In November, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission
announced that each of the three casinos applied for a
license for land-based sports betting, while a total of 12
operators had filed applications for the 15 potential mobile
sports wagering licenses or skins. The commission ended
the year nearing completion of a rulemaking process to
implement a regulatory framework for sports betting, with
the intention of allowing land-based sportsbooks to launch
in late January 2023, followed by mobile wagering in
March.

Expansion
Also in August, Gov. Baker signed a separate bill related
to veterans’ affairs that required the formation of a

special commission to study the potential authorization of
electronic gaming devices in the state’s veterans’ halls.

An earlier version of the bill as passed by the
Massachusetts House would have authorized up to five
electronic gaming devices in veterans’ establishments,
subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Gaming
Commission. That language was removed from the
veterans’ affairs bill by the Senate, before a panel of House
members and senators then compromised on mandating a
formal study of the issue.

The study commission’s policy recommendations are due
by June 2023.

Responsible Gaming
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission oversaw several
responsible gaming-related initiatives in 2022.

In September, Massachusetts’ PlayMyWay play
management system was launched at Encore Boston
Harbor—expanding the program to include all three of
the state’s commercial casino properties. The unique
tool enables participating patrons to set responsible
gaming limits according to the amount they wish to spend
wagering via electronic gaming devices. PlayMyWay was
initially launched on a pilot basis at Plainridge Park Casino
in 2016 before being extended to the two Massachusetts
casino-resorts in 2022. MGM Springfield deployed the
program through its electronic gaming devices in April.

Separately, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in
June published a white paper on responsible gaming
considerations for gambling advertising. The white paper’s
recommendations included proposals to ensure advertising
does not appeal to persons aged under 21 and prevent
unsolicited pop-up advertising on digital channels.

MICHIGAN

Powered by the rapid growth of Michigan’s iGaming

market, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue reached a record total of $3.26 billion in 2022.

Market Overview
Michigan offers commercial casino gaming at three land-based casinos, each
of which operates electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting.
The casinos are regulated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB).

Commercial casinos were first authorized in 1996, when Michigan voters
approved a referendum permitting a maximum of three casinos in Detroit.

In December 2019, lawmakers authorized the state’s commercial casinos
and 12 recognized Indian tribes to offer statewide online sports betting and
iGaming through a single sportsbook, casino and poker platform affiliated with
each casino or tribe. Online gaming commenced in January 2021. At the end
of 2022, a total of 15 online sportsbooks, 14 internet casinos and three online
poker platforms were operational.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $3.26 billion,
up 20.7 percent relative to the previous year.

The record total reflected Michigan’s rapid emergence as one of the largest
regulated iGaming markets in the world. Total revenue from internet casino
games and poker surpassed that of land-based commercial casino gaming and
amounted to $1.58 billion, up 42.1 percent from 2021. Revenue from online
sports betting was $399.6 million, up 36.8 percent.

Meanwhile, traditional casino gaming revenue reported by Detroit’s three land-
based commercial casinos declined in 2022.

Michigan

Commercial casinos reported $1.26 billion in revenue
from electronic gaming devices and table games in their
facilities, a decrease of 0.8 percent from the previous year.
The three casinos also reported land-based sports betting
revenue of $19.1 million, down 30.2 percent versus 2021.
Total sports betting revenue in Michigan in 2022 was
$418.6 million, up 31.0 percent.

Revenue from online sports betting is taxed at 8.4
percent, applied after deductions of free bets and other
bonuses and promotions. Online sportsbooks affiliated
with the Detroit casinos pay the same municipal tax as per
iGaming, while online sports betting operations are further
subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied to
wagering handle.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Land-based casino gaming revenue is taxed at 19 percent
for electronic gaming devices and table games, with 10.9
percent directed to the host city of Detroit and 8.1 percent
allocated for the state. Revenue from land-based sports
betting is subject to an effective tax rate of 8.4 percent.
In addition to revenue-based taxes, casinos are required
to remit annual services fees to state and municipal
governments.

Revenue from iGaming is subjected to a graduated tax
rate that ranges from 20 percent on revenue less than $4
million, to 28 percent on revenue exceeding $12 million,
with limited deductions for promotional credits offered to
patrons. Internet casinos affiliated with the three Detroit
commercial casinos are also required to pay a municipal
fee of 1.25 percent.

MICHIGAN: COMMERCIAL GAMING REVENUE BY SOURCE
2009 to 2022

A package of bills approved in late 2019 has fundamentally
altered the dynamics of Michigan’s commercial casino
gaming industry, with the state now reporting more revenue
from iGaming via online casinos than from traditional
electronic gaming devices and table games operated by the
three land-based commercial casinos located in Detroit.

In 2022, Michigan’s three commercial casinos and its
regulated iGaming and online sports betting platforms
generated estimated total gaming tax revenue of
approximately $734.0 million, up 20.8 percent from
2021. Of this amount, approximately $443.3 million
was remitted to the state, with $257.8 million going to
the Detroit city government. A further $32.8 million in
iGaming taxes was remitted to tribal governments.

The City of Detroit uses the gaming taxes it receives to
fund a variety of public needs, including law enforcement,
public safety programs, economic development and job
creation programs, anti-gang and youth development
programs, tax relief, and infrastructure improvements.
Most gaming tax revenue that the state receives is
allocated to the Michigan School Aid Fund, which benefits
K-12 public education. Additional portions of tax revenue
generated by iGaming are appropriated for first-responder
programs and problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape
In addition to commercial casinos in Detroit, Michigan’s
broader gaming market includes 23 tribal casinos
operated by 12 sovereign tribal nations, which are located
throughout the state. The three commercial casinos also
compete directly with a casino-resort in Windsor, Ontario
located on the opposite bank of the Detroit River.

Due to a state constitutional amendment passed in 2004,
any new commercial casino gaming facility, or the addition
of casino gaming at existing venues such as racetracks,
must first receive the approval of a majority of voters both
statewide and in the locality where gaming will take place.
Notwithstanding that, Michigan’s Senate has formerly
attempted to pass legislation to authorize electronic
gaming devices at racetracks based on the outcome of
historical horse races; such legislation has so far not been
able to pass in the House, however.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming
In May, the Michigan Gaming Control Board announced
it had joined Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey as a
signatory of the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement,
enabling online poker players in Michigan to compete

against those in the other three member states subject to
regulatory approval.

The board published a series of regulatory guidelines for
operators of multistate poker games in April, addressing
issues related to technology approvals, supplier and
key employee licensing, as well as inspection of gaming
equipment located out-of-state. In December, the board
approved PokerStars to combine its Michigan and New
Jersey online poker players. The PokerStars offering
became the second interstate poker network in the United
States, joining an established poker network combining
poker players from Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey.

In theory, multistate poker play offers a more attractive
experience for players as operators can offer a broader
range of games and tournaments, with larger prize pools.
In 2022, peer-to-peer poker games accounted for just 1.6
percent of total iGaming revenue nationwide, according to
VIXIO GamblingCompliance estimates.

Fantasy Sports
In April, the Michigan Gaming Control Board approved
regulations for fantasy sports contests, in accordance with
a 2019 state law.

License applications for fantasy contest operators were
released by the board in May, with operators required to
submit an application prior to a July 1 deadline in order
to remain active in the state. By the end of the year, six
fantasy contest operators had applied for a Michigan
license.

Michigan became the 22nd state to subject fantasy sports
contests to a specific regulatory or licensing regime.

Responsible Gaming
In July, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed a state budget
law that included additional funding for a responsible
gaming awareness campaign to be administered by the
Michigan Gaming Control Board.

The board requested the $3 million responsible gaming
appropriation as well as additional funds to hire more staff
and procure new technologies in light of the significant
growth of iGaming and online sports betting in Michigan.

MISSISSIPPI

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $2.57 billion, down 3.6 percent from

2021, partly reflecting the competitive impact of legal

sports betting in neighboring Louisiana.

Market Overview
Mississippi offers commercial casino gaming at 26 land-based and riverboat
casinos located along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast. The casinos,
which offer electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting, are
regulated by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

The Mississippi legislature first authorized casino gaming in 1990, strictly
limiting it to facilities docked on waterways. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005,
the legislature passed a new law authorizing commercial casinos on the state’s
Gulf Coast to rebuild on dry land so long as those casinos remained within 800
feet of the water. Casinos began offering sports betting in August 2018.

While there is no statutory limit on the number of commercial casinos that can
be established in Mississippi, casino projects must meet certain minimum
criteria in order to receive a license.

Market Performance
In 2022, Mississippi’s commercial casinos generated total gaming revenue of
$2.57 billion, down 3.6 percent relative to the previous year.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices as reported by the
Mississippi Gaming Commission was $2.10 billion, down 4.1 percent versus
2021. In contrast, table game revenue was $371.1 million, up 0.9 percent.

Facing fresh competition from the launch of land-based and mobile sports
wagering in next door Louisiana, Mississippi’s sports betting market suffered a

decline in annual revenue in 2022. Total statewide sports
betting revenue was $60.8 million, down 7.7 percent on
the prior year.

While overall commercial casino gaming revenue declined
in markets across the state, the decrease was more
pronounced for casinos on the Mississippi River than those
casino-resorts in the Gulf Coast region that includes the
city of Biloxi.

Riverboat casinos located in the north and central regions
of the Mississippi River reported combined gaming revenue
of $973.9 million in 2022, down 8.2 percent against
2021. Gulf Coast casinos meanwhile reported total gaming
revenue of $1.60 billion, down just 0.5 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Mississippi imposes a graduated tax based on monthly
gaming revenue. Casinos pay a 4 percent tax on gross gaming
revenue that falls below $50,000 per month; 6 percent on
revenue between $50,000 and $134,000 per month; and 8
percent on gaming revenue exceeding $134,000.

In addition, each of the local Mississippi municipalities
that host commercial casinos charge an additional annual
license fee at an average rate of 3-4 percent of gaming
revenue. Revenue from sports wagering is taxed at the same
state and local rates as revenue from traditional casino
games. Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Mississippi commercial casinos generated
approximately $303.0 million in direct gaming tax revenue,
down 2.7 percent against the previous year, according to
statistics collected by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Of that total amount, approximately $164.4 million was
distributed to Mississippi’s General Fund and is subject to
annual appropriations to support various state budgetary
needs, including education programs, transportation, local
public safety programs and social welfare initiatives.

An additional $102.6 million worth of gaming tax revenue
in 2022 was transferred to local governments that
host casinos. A further $36 million was allocated for
Mississippi’s Special Bond Sinking Fund, which is mainly
used to pay for improvements to state roads and bridges.

Competitive Landscape
Mississippi’s commercial casinos compete in a crowded
statewide gaming market that also includes three tribal
casino-resorts owned by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw
Indians. Unlike the 26 commercial properties along the
Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River, the three tribal
casinos are located in the center of the state near Jackson,
the state’s largest city.

Commercial casino operators also face significant
competition from properties in neighboring states. Mississippi
casinos in the Tunica/Lula market compete directly with
Arkansas’ Southland Casino Racing racino for patrons from
the Memphis area. Meanwhile, Mississippi Gulf Coast casinos
compete with various casinos in Louisiana.

While Mississippi casinos gained an initial competitive
advantage over Louisiana properties after launching
sportsbook operations in 2018, that advantage was lost
in late 2021 and early 2022 through the launch of legal
sports betting in Louisiana casinos and mobile sportsbook
platforms available in most parts of the state.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
Mississippi lawmakers rejected a series of gaming
proposals during the state’s 2022 legislative session.

For the fourth year running, and despite the launch of legal
online sports wagering across Louisiana at the start of the
year, House and Senate bills to authorize statewide mobile
sports betting failed to pass the committee stage.

Meanwhile, separate proposals to authorize electronic
gaming devices at retail locations, truck stops or
Mississippi airports similarly all failed to gain traction and
died in House and Senate committees.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was a record $1.91 billion, table game growth

offset a slight decline in revenue from electronic gaming

Market Overview
Missouri offers commercial casino gaming at 13 riverboat casinos, each of
which operates electronic gaming devices and table games. The casinos are
regulated by the Missouri Gaming Commission.

In 1992, Missouri voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow
“gambling excursion boats” on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, subject
to approval from voters in casinos’ host communities. Following a 2008
referendum, the Missouri market may not expand beyond the initial 13
properties without the approval of voters via a statewide constitutional
referendum.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $1.91 billion,
up 0.5 percent versus the previous year.

The record total was achieved as growth in table game revenue offset a slight

Missouri

Gaming Tax Distribution
Missouri commercial casino gaming revenue is taxed at 21
percent. Additionally, there is a $2 admission fee for every
two hours that each patron is on board a riverboat.

The primary obstacle for sports betting was the desire
of certain Missouri senators to attach additional gaming
expansion provisions to authorize the Missouri Lottery to
operate a network of electronic gaming devices in bars and
other retail locations.

In 2022, Missouri’s commercial casinos generated
total gaming tax revenue of $458.0 million, including
admissions fees, a slight decrease of 0.2 percent versus
the previous year.

The majority of gaming tax revenue, approximately
$360.1 million in 2022, is reserved for Missouri’s Gaming
Proceeds For Education Fund. The fund was created by the
Missouri legislature in 1993 and distributes funds annually
to statewide education programs.

In 2022, approximately $68.9 million in gaming taxes
and admissions fees was paid to local governments that
host Missouri’s casinos, while some $28.9 million was set
aside for other recipients, including veterans initiatives and
the state’s National Guard, that are supported by a state
gaming fund.

Competitive Landscape
Missouri’s commercial casinos face significant and expanding
out-of-state competition. The state’s trio of casinos in the
Kansas City area compete directly with a fourth casino in
Kansas City, Kansas. Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway
gained a competitive advantage over the three Missouri
casinos in 2022 when it opened a sportsbook thanks to new
legislation that authorized sports wagering in Kansas.

Missouri casinos in the St. Louis market compete with
two casinos in East St. Louis and Alton, Illinois. Additional
competition is pending as a result of a casino expansion bill
passed in Illinois in 2019 that authorized electronic gaming

Horse Racing facility at Fairmount Park racetrack as well as
a new casino in Williamson County, roughly 60 miles from
Missouri’s Century Casino Cape Girardeau.

Bills to authorize sports betting and video lottery terminal
devices are expected to be reintroduced in 2023.

Payments Modernization
In February, the Missouri Gaming Commission voted to
approve new rules to facilitate the adoption of cashless
wagering systems by Missouri commercial casinos.

Under the Missouri regulations, cashless wagering for
electronic gaming devices can be accessed through an app
available to members of a casino’s player loyalty program.
That app can be used to fund gaming directly from the
player’s mobile device using monies deposited via a digital
wallet. The app also must offer players the ability to set
limits on their wagering.

Similar rules for cashless gaming had already been
approved in various states including Nevada.

Missouri’s amended regulations and minimum internal
control standards were formally adopted in May following
a mandatory comment period and became effective in
September.

The Montana Lottery reported total sports betting

revenue of approximately $7.2 million in 2022, a 12

percent annual increase, as wagering kiosks were

deployed to additional retail locations.

Market Overview
Montana has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through a
network of sports wagering kiosks operated by the Montana Lottery.

A May 2019 state law authorized the Montana Lottery to operate sports
wagering via electronic devices and mobile applications available on the
premises of approved retail locations that are already licensed to host limited-
stakes electronic gaming devices, charitable gaming or bingo. Sports betting is
regulated by the Montana Lottery Commission.

Market Performance
In 2022, total sports betting revenue generated by the Montana Lottery
amounted to $7.2 million, up 12.0 percent from the previous year.

The growth partly reflected the expansion of the Sports Bet Montana program
to additional retail locations. By the end of 2022, sports wagering kiosks were
available in more than 500 locations, versus around 450 at the start of the year.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Sports betting operated by the Montana Lottery is not subject to taxation
per se; instead, the lottery returns all net revenue after operating expenses,
including marketing and technology costs and retailer commissions, to specific
programs as determined by the state legislature. As sports betting is operated

directly by the state, it is not subject to the 0.25 percent
federal excise tax applied to commercial operators’
wagering handle.

In 2022, sports betting generated profits for the Montana
Lottery of approximately $2.7 million, up 40.7 percent
relative to the previous year. Under state law, all net
profits generated by the Montana Lottery are distributed
either to the state’s General Fund or to a scholarship fund
to prepare high school students for degrees in science,
technology, engineering or healthcare.

Competitive Landscape
In addition to sports betting, Montana’s wider gaming
market includes 15 tribal casinos and three horse
racetracks. Licensed bars and charitable gaming locations
can also be licensed to offer limited card games, bingo,
charitable sports pools and up to 20 limited-stakes
electronic gaming devices.

Montana faces limited regional competition for sports
betting in the shape of online sports wagering platforms
that are available to its south in Wyoming, as well as land-
based sportsbook operations at commercial casinos in the
city of Deadwood in South Dakota.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In April, the Montana Lottery Commission voted to approve
a pilot program in which the Sports Bet Montana program
could be offered on a mobile-only basis in bars and other
retail locations, without accompanying sports wagering
kiosks to accept cash wagers. Bets could instead only be
accepted through the patron’s account established with
the Montana Lottery’s sports betting app.

Under the program, the retailer would receive half the
rate of commission on all bets placed compared with a
full-service sports wagering location, on the basis that the
retailer would not have to handle cash or dedicate any floor
space for the kiosks.

With mobile wagering available exclusively on an on-
site basis at licensed retailers, the Montana Lottery has
reported more than 90 percent of bets being placed
through physical kiosks rather than mobile devices.

NEBRASKA

Nebraska reported total commercial casino gaming

revenue of $14.0 million in 2022 in less than four

months of operations at the state’s first two racinos.

Market Overview
Nebraska offers commercial casino gaming at two racinos. At the end of 2022,
the two temporary racino facilities were limited to electronic gaming devices and
electronic table games, with additional gaming offerings to be launched upon
the opening of permanent casino properties in 2023.

In 2020, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to allow commercial
casino gaming at licensed racetracks in Nebraska. State lawmakers approved
a bill in 2021 to implement the voter referendum, with that legislation also
allowing sports betting to be offered at racinos alongside traditional electronic
gaming device and table game operations. Casino gaming is regulated by the
Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission.

amendment, Nebraska commercial casinos are
subject to a state tax of 20 percent of gaming
revenue. Forthcoming sportsbook operations at
racinos will also be subject to a 0.25 percent
federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, Nebraska’s first two licensed racinos
generated approximately $2.8 million in gaming
tax revenue.

Under Nebraska’s constitution, 70 percent of
casino gaming tax revenue is allocated to the
state’s Property Tax Credit Cash Fund. A further
25 percent of tax revenue is distributed to
the host county, city and village governments
of each racino, with the remaining 5 percent
split evenly between a compulsive gambling
assistance fund and Nebraska’s General Fund.

Competitive Landscape
After launching in September 2022, Nebraska’s
commercial casino gaming market remains very much
in its infancy, with future expansion to include the
development of permanent casino facilities at the state’s
initial two racinos as well as the rollout of casino gaming at
the state’s four other licensed horse racetracks in Omaha,
Columbus, Hastings and South Sioux City.

The forthcoming racinos in Omaha and South Sioux City
will compete directly with several commercial casinos in
Council Bluffs and Sioux City, Iowa. There are also five
established tribal casinos on Indian reservation lands in
Nebraska.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
In April, then-Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) signed a bill to amend
Nebraska’s 2021 casino legislation and clarify various
provisions ahead of the launch of casino gaming at state-
licensed racetracks.

Among other things, the new law specified that certain
Nebraska racetracks would be permitted to move to a
new location in the state and receive a license to conduct
casino gaming only after the completion of a formal market
analysis to be published no sooner than January 2025.
The legislation also required racinos to conduct a minimum
number of live race days annually in order to retain a
casino gaming license.

Another provision of the legislation required the Nebraska
Racing and Gaming Commission to establish a centralized
self-exclusion register applicable to all racinos in the state.

Separately, the Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission
took several steps in 2022 to facilitate the opening of the
state’s commercial casino gaming market.

In May, the commission approved minimum internal
control standards for casino operations. Two months later,
the regulatory agency also approved formal policies related
to the shipping and storage of electronic gaming devices
and other types of gaming equipment sold or leased to
licensed racinos by approved gaming suppliers.

Sports Betting
In October, the Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission
approved amended casino gaming regulations to
incorporate specific rules related to sports wagering.
Initial casino regulations approved in 2021 referenced the
possibility of sports betting, but did not include detailed
operating requirements.

Among other things, the amended regulations addressed
the types of events eligible for wagering via sportsbooks at
Nebraska racinos, reserve requirements for operators, and
the testing and certification of sports wagering equipment.

Legal sports betting had not begun in Nebraska at the end
of 2022, but was expected to launch sometime in 2023 in
accordance with the new regulations.

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was a record $14.84 billion as out-of-state

tourists returned in greater numbers to Las Vegas for

entertainment and business conventions.

Market Overview
After establishing the first modern regulatory system for casino gaming in the
late 1950s, Nevada has a longstanding reputation as a premier domestic and
international gaming destination welcoming millions of visitors to its casino-
resorts each year.

Nevada became the first state to legalize iGaming in 2001 before adopting
regulations ten years later limited to online poker games. Exempted from the
1992 congressional law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting
until 2018, Nevada is also the longest running market for legal sports wagering
in the United States.

The state’s commercial casinos are regulated by the Nevada Gaming Control
Board (NGCB) and Nevada Gaming Commission (NGC), with no restrictions on
the number of licenses available.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was an all-time
record $14.84 billion, up 10.5 percent compared to the previous record-setting
year of 2021.

Total statewide gaming revenue from electronic gaming devices was $10.01
billion, up 8.4 percent versus the prior year, while revenue from table games
was $4.39 billion, up 17.2 percent.

Facing mounting competition from other states with legal sports wagering,
Nevada saw the growth of its own sports betting market plateau in 2022. While

still a record total, statewide sports betting revenue of
$446.7 million was up just 0.4 percent against 2021.

Reflecting Nevada’s status as a major tourist destination
for out-of-state visitors and regulatory restrictions that
continue to require in-person registration of mobile sports
wagering accounts, land-based sportsbook operations
continued to generate a majority—approximately 54.5
percent—of overall sports betting revenue in 2022.

Record overall gaming revenue defied inflationary and
other macroeconomic concerns afflicting the U.S. economy
and suggested continued strong demand for travel and
entertainment among American consumers in the wake
of the pandemic. Notably, many Nevada casino-resorts
offered a far wider range of non-gaming amenities in 2022
compared to the prior year, when various shows, business
conventions and other events remained suspended for at
least part of the year due to concerns related to COVID-19.

In 2022, Las Vegas received some 38.8 million visits
from tourists, up 20.5 percent from 2021 but still below
pre-pandemic numbers, as visitors on average spent more
on gaming entertainment than in previous years. Business
convention attendance more than doubled to nearly five
million, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority.

With a wider range of entertainment offerings available,
it was the casino-resorts on the Las Vegas Strip that
drove overall growth of the Nevada commercial casino
gaming market in 2022. Commercial casinos on the Las
Vegas Strip reported total revenue from electronic gaming
devices and table games of $8.11 billion, up 17.1 percent
relative to 2021, while those in other parts of Nevada that
are somewhat less dependent on tourist visitation reported
gaming revenue of $6.29 billion, up a more modest 3.6
percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Nevada commercial casinos are subject to a state tax
of 6.75 percent on all gross gaming revenue exceeding
$134,000 per month, with lower rates applying to revenue
below that threshold.

Casino operators are also subject to a tax on live
entertainment offerings hosted within their resorts.
Additionally, quarterly and annual fees are assessed
according to the number of electronic gaming devices and
table games installed on casinos’ gaming floors.

Meanwhile, host counties and municipalities may impose
additional fees. Nevada sportsbook operations are further
subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied to
wagering handle.

In 2022, Nevada collected a total of $1.15 billion in
state gaming and live entertainment taxes revenue from
commercial casinos, an increase of 12.5 percent versus
the prior year.

In accordance with state law, the vast majority of tax
revenue from gaming is directed to Nevada’s General Fund,
then redistributed on a biennial basis at the direction of
the legislature for purposes including statewide education
programs, transportation services and general budgetary
needs. Additional funds are earmarked for local school
systems and county governments.

Competitive Landscape
As one of the world’s foremost destinations for
entertainment and business conventions, Las Vegas faces
a somewhat different competitive environment than most
other U.S. gaming markets.

While Las Vegas’ commercial casinos compete for drive-
in patrons to some extent with southern California tribal
casinos, the city as a whole also competes with various
national and international locations for discretionary tourist
and business traveler dollars.

After Resorts World Las Vegas in 2021 became the first
new casino-resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip in more
than a decade, a second new resort – the long-stalled
Fontainebleau Las Vegas project – is scheduled to follow
in late 2023. Various other casino-resorts including The
Mirage, now owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida, have
announced plans to upgrade their facilities or develop new
amenities.

Outside of Las Vegas, commercial casinos in Reno and
other parts of northern Nevada continue to face increasing
competition from the dozens of tribal casinos in northern
California, including one major new tribal casino-resort
that opened near Sacramento in August 2022.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Cybersecurity
In December, the Nevada Gaming Commission voted to
adopt new regulatory requirements designed to mitigate
risks of cyber attacks affecting commercial casino
operators and other gaming licensees in the state.

Under the updated regulations, which were approved
following a series of stakeholder workshops, all Nevada
casino operators will be required to perform a risk
assessment of their businesses and document formal
cybersecurity best practices. These best practices would
then have to be audited and reviewed at least annually
thereafter.

The esports advisory committee was established through
legislation passed during Nevada’s 2021 session and the
eight-member panel held a series of informational hearings
prior to issuing its recommendations. To become effective,
the proposed regulatory changes require formal adoption
by the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Regulatory Reform
In January, the Nevada Gaming Commission approved
new regulations to allow casino gaming accounts to be
established remotely, without a patron having to appear
in-person before a casino employee in order to verify their
identity.

The regulations, which are not applicable to accounts
for mobile sports betting, were brought forward in part
to facilitate the adoption of cashless gaming in Nevada
casinos and enable patrons to create and fund a cashless
wagering account via a mobile application.

Other regulatory reforms either proposed or adopted by
Nevada gaming regulators in 2022 included clarifying
licensing requirements for suppliers of non-gaming
equipment and providers of data used to determine the
outcome of sports betting events.

Nevada

Any successful cyber attack must be reported to the
Nevada Gaming Control Board within a maximum of 72
hours, with the results of investigations into such attacks
also made available to the board upon request.

Like other major commercial operations, casinos and other
gaming businesses have suffered several high-profile cyber
attacks in recent years. Nevada follows New Jersey in
adopting specific gaming regulations governing the issue.

Sports Betting
In October, a special advisory committee to the Nevada
Gaming Control Board approved regulatory amendments to
facilitate betting on esports contests.

Under current regulations, Nevada sportsbook operators
are required to submit event-specific requests for each and
every esports tournament they wish to offer wagers on. The
Nevada Esports Technical Advisory Committee’s proposed
amendments would instead allow sportsbook operators
to offer wagering on esports contests without specific
regulatory approval, provided they have been provided
with sufficient information about the contests to assuage
potential integrity concerns. The chair of the Nevada
Gaming Control Board would also retain authority to waive
conditions applicable to esports betting in the case of
events organized by approved sanctioning bodies.

A state law passed in July 2019 authorized the New Hampshire Lottery to offer
sports betting through mobile platforms and at up to ten retail sportsbook
locations by partnering with a maximum of five private operators to conduct
sports wagering on its behalf. The lottery is also authorized to directly operate
sports lottery parlay games through its traditional network of retailers.

Through a request for proposals process, the New Hampshire Lottery selected
DraftKings to be its exclusive agent for mobile and retail sports wagering.
DraftKings’ New Hampshire mobile sportsbook was launched in December
2019. At the end of 2022, retail sports betting was also available at three retail

for 89.1 percent of total sports betting revenue, compared
with 79.9 percent during the first full year of retail sports
wagering in New Hampshire in 2021.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from commercial sports betting in New
Hampshire is subject to an effective tax rate of 51
percent for mobile sports wagering and 50 percent for
retail sportsbook locations, with limited deductions for
promotional credits offered to patrons.

Those were the revenue-sharing terms DraftKings agreed
to as part of its 2019 contract to serve as the New
Hampshire Lottery’s exclusive sports betting agent for both
channels.

Lottery-operated parlay sports betting will be subject to
an effective tax rate of 19.25 percent, once it becomes
operational.

In 2022, sports betting generated total tax revenue of
approximately $31.0 million, up 54.8 percent on the
previous year.

The vast majority of that total was distributed to the New
Hampshire Education Trust Fund, which provides grants
to the state’s local school districts. Additional gaming
taxes were allocated to cover administrative costs and to
fund a new state responsible gambling council that was
established under the 2019 sports betting law.

Competitive Landscape
In 2022, New Hampshire lost the competitive advantage
it had enjoyed relative to its New England neighbors on
sports wagering. Both Maine and Massachusetts approved
legislation during the course of the year, while Vermont
legislators adopted policy recommendations modeled
on New Hampshire’s law with an eye on passing a bill in
2023.

Aside from sports betting, New Hampshire’s broader gaming
market includes a racetrack and simulcast facilities, as well
as 17 charitable gaming locations that are authorized to
operate electronic bingo devices and historical horse racing
terminals, among other games. The New Hampshire Lottery
also offers a range of online lottery games.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
In January, the New Hampshire Lottery adopted
regulations to govern the operation of electronic gaming
devices based on the outcome of historical horse races at
licensed charitable gaming locations in the state.

New Hampshire’s first historical horse racing operations
were launched in May. By the end of 2022, the devices
were available in seven charitable gaming facilities.

Legislation to authorize historical horse racing was signed
into law in June 2021, with New Hampshire joining seven
other states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and
Virginia, in approving the devices.

In a related policy development, Gov. Chris Sununu (R)
signed a bill into law in June to authorize extended opening
hours for licensed charitable gaming locations in New
Hampshire. The new law permitted charitable gaming
facilities to remain open between the hours of 8 a.m. and
4 a.m., instead of the previous hours of 11 a.m. until 1 a.m.

NEW JERSEY

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue increased 10.0 percent to $5.21 billion, as

ongoing growth in iGaming offset a decline in sports

wagering and led the New Jersey market to its best

revenue performance since 2006.

Market Overview
New Jersey offers commercial casino gaming at nine land-based casinos located
in Atlantic City. The casinos, which operate electronic gaming devices, table
games, and sports betting, are regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Sports betting is
also available at state-licensed horse racetracks that do not offer other forms of
casino gaming.

New Jersey voters first approved casino gaming in 1976 via a constitutional
amendment that restricted casinos to Atlantic City. The state’s first commercial
casino opened two years later.

Internet gaming was legalized in 2013, with online and land-based sports
betting following in 2018 after New Jersey successfully challenged a federal
ban on sports wagering before the U.S. Supreme Court. At the close of 2022, a
total of 31 internet casinos and 23 online sportsbooks were operational.

Market Performance
Total statewide gaming revenue reached $5.21 billion in 2022, up 10.0 percent
from 2021.

The 2022 gaming revenue total was also the New Jersey market’s second
highest ever, falling just shy of 2006’s all-time record of $5.22 billion that
came prior to the rollout of competing commercial casino gaming in neighboring
Pennsylvania.

New Jersey

At that time commercial casino gaming was limited to
land-based casino operations in Atlantic City, whereas the
New Jersey market’s growth of more recent years has been
primarily driven by iGaming and sports wagering.

Compared with 2021, revenue from traditional land-
based casino gaming offerings in Atlantic City increased
9.0 percent to $2.79 billion. Total statewide revenue
from electronic gaming devices was $2.04 billion, up 9.0
percent versus the prior year, while table game revenue
was $741.7 million, up 9.1 percent.

Internet gaming continued to see strong growth in New
Jersey in 2022, with total revenue reaching $1.66 billion,
up 21.6 percent versus the previous year.

In contrast, annual sports betting revenue declined for
the first time as New Jersey’s land-based and online
sportsbooks suffered from the increased cross-border
competition that came with the launch of legal mobile
sports wagering in neighboring New York in early January.

Total sports wagering revenue in New Jersey was $763.0
million, a decline of 6.5 percent relative to 2021, as
sportsbooks reported a comparable handle—or total
amounts wagered—but lower hold. Online sports wagering
revenue was $721.6 million, down 2.6 percent versus the
previous year, while land-based sports wagering revenue
suffered a sharper decline of 45.2 percent to $41.4
million.

In 2022, total commercial gaming revenue in New Jersey

Gaming Tax Distribution
New Jersey commercial gaming revenue is taxed at varying
rates depending on the type of gaming offered, and
whether games are played at land-based facilities or via
online platforms.

Land-based commercial casino gaming revenue is taxed at
an effective rate of 9.25 percent. That rate comprises an 8
percent state gaming tax and a 1.25 percent obligation for
investment in economic development projects in Atlantic
City and throughout New Jersey.

Internet casino gaming revenue, meanwhile, is taxed at an
effective rate of 17.5 percent, comprised of a 15 percent
state gaming tax and a 2.5 percent community investment
obligation.

Revenue from land-based sports betting is taxed at an
effective rate of 9.75 percent, while online sports betting
is taxed at 14.25 percent. Sportsbook operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied
to wagering handle.

In 2022, New Jersey commercial casinos and racetracks
generated approximately $612.4 million in total state
tax revenue from gaming operations, an increase of 9.0
percent on the previous year.

Of the 2022 total, approximately $526.4 million was
deposited into the New Jersey Casino Revenue Fund,
which is appropriated each fiscal year for the exclusive
benefit of New Jersey’s senior citizens and disabled
residents.

On top of the Casino Revenue Fund, approximately $85.9
million was generated by gaming for separate funds that
either support economic development and community
projects in Atlantic City, or the local municipal and
county governments that host racetracks with sportsbook
operations.

Competitive Landscape
New Jersey commercial casinos compete in a crowded
Mid-Atlantic region that includes five casino properties in
the Greater Philadelphia market that has historically served
as a key feeder market to Atlantic City.

Looking ahead, the main competitive challenge for New
Jersey’s commercial casino gaming market comes from the
licensing of three major casino-resorts in the New York City
area as authorized under New York’s 2022 state budget.
While New York City already hosts two casino gaming
facilities offering electronic gaming devices, New Yorkers
have historically frequented Atlantic City casinos for table
games and other resort offerings.

New Jersey

The importance of New York as an out-of-state source of
gaming patrons was underscored in 2022 by New Jersey’s
decline in sports wagering revenue. The availability of legal
mobile sports betting means New Yorkers no longer have to
cross state lines to place their wagers, although the higher
tax rate applied to sports betting revenue and absence
of internet casino games in New York means New Jersey
operators may be able to offer greater breadth of products
to encourage their New York customers to continue to
travel across the Hudson River.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming
New Jersey introduced heightened responsible gaming
standards for iGaming in 2022, applicable to all online
casino and sportsbook operators.

The new standards—which were shared with operators
by the Division of Gaming Enforcement in June but not
effective until January 2023—require internet casinos
and sportsbook platforms to have systems in place to
monitor player activities and flag potential signs of problem
gambling. Each operator also must have a specialist
responsible gaming team to intervene in providing

resources and information to those at-risk patrons flagged
by the automated systems.

The new standards are not a formal regulatory requirement
and were developed instead as best practices to
give regulators more leeway to adjust them upon
implementation by the industry.

Cybersecurity
Two further sets of best practices were implemented by
the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement in July to
address risks of online fraud associated with iGaming.

New best practices on cybersecurity required internet
casino and sports betting operators to apply multi-
factor authentication for all player accounts in order to
prevent account takeover fraud or so-called credential
stuffing attacks. Under the new standards, patrons must
supplement their password with a knowledge-based
question, biometric data, electronic token or code in order
to log in to their accounts. Multi-factor authentication is
required for any new devices used by the patron, or at two-
week intervals when the patron is using a known device.

A further set of best practices related to know your
customer (KYC) protocols required operators to use multi-
source authentication to verify the identities of patrons
establishing new iGaming accounts.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices

at commercial casinos was $262.0 million in 2022,

New Mexico racinos’ first full year of operations since

2019.

Market Overview
New Mexico offers commercial casino gaming at five racinos. Electronic gaming
devices at licensed racetracks were authorized under a 1997 state law and are
regulated by the New Mexico Gaming Control Board.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

Although there is no statutory limit on the number of racinos that may operate
in New Mexico, under the state’s existing compacts with its federally-recognized
tribes, no more than six commercial racinos are allowed.

CASINO TAX REVENUE 2022
$121.2M

Racinos are restricted to a maximum of 750 electronic gaming devices and
are not permitted to offer table games. New Mexico is also the only state that
maintains restrictions on the operating hours at all of its commercial casino
properties. Electronic gaming devices at racetracks may only be operated on
days when live or simulcast horse races are being held, up to 18 hours per day,
and may not exceed a total of 112 operating hours in a one-week period.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $262.0
million. That total was up 21.2 percent from 2021 and reflected the racino
industry’s first full year of operations since the pandemic.

New Mexico’s racinos suffered the longest shutdown of all commercial casino
gaming properties in the United States due to government pandemic restrictions
and did not receive permission to reopen their gaming floors until late February
2021, after closing in March 2020.

While state law provides for a sixth racino in the state,
the New Mexico Racing Commission in 2018 rejected all

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
After state lawmakers were publicly urged by racino
operators in late 2020 and 2021 to pass reforms to
improve the competitiveness of the state’s commercial
casino gaming industry, 2022 was a quieter year on the
legislative front.

A 2021 bill to authorize table games and sports betting at
the state’s five commercial racinos and remove limits on
the operating hours of commercial casino properties was
not reintroduced.

In February, a bill was filed in the New Mexico Senate
requesting that various legislative committees undertake
a formal review of the state’s gaming market and potential
expansion initiatives, including authorization of iGaming,
that could boost its competitiveness relative to other
states. The bill was not passed by senators, however,
before the legislature adjourned its 2022 session.

New Mexico

Gaming Tax Distribution
New Mexico commercial casino gaming revenue is taxed at
an effective rate of 46.25 percent.

In 2022, New Mexico commercial racinos generated total
gaming tax revenue of approximately $121.2 million, up
21.2 percent against the previous year.

Of that amount, roughly $68.1 million was distributed
to the state’s General Fund, which is allocated each year
for state budgetary expenditures by the New Mexico
Department of Revenue, subject to approval by the state
legislature.

An additional $52.4 million in commercial casino gaming
tax revenue was distributed to New Mexico’s horse racing
industry to supplement race purses, with the remainder
allocated to fund problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape
New Mexico commercial casinos face considerable
competition from the state’s 21 tribal casinos. Unlike
the state’s racinos, tribal casinos are permitted to offer
table games and sports betting in addition to electronic
gaming devices. New Mexico racinos face more limited
competition from licensed non-profit organizations, such
as veteran and fraternal groups, which are authorized to

NEW YORK

Bolstered by the launch of mobile sports betting, total

commercial casino gaming revenue increased more

than 55 percent to $4.23 billion in 2022. Sports betting

revenue of $1.37 billion made New York by far the

largest sports wagering market in the nation.

Market Overview
New York’s commercial gaming market includes seven properties with electronic
gaming devices and horse racing, four casino-resorts offering electronic gaming
devices, table games and sports betting, and two land-based properties offering
electronic gaming devices. Commercial gaming is regulated by the New York
State Gaming Commission.

Commercial casino gaming was first authorized by a 2001 law that allowed for
the operation of electronic gaming devices at racetracks under the authority of
the New York Lottery.

In 2013, voters approved a constitutional amendment to permit up to seven
commercial casinos and lawmakers enacted legislation to authorize a maximum
of four casino-resorts in different regions of upstate New York. Additionally
legislation enacted in 2022 authorized a licensing process for the final three
casino-resorts permitted under the state constitution, to be sited in the New
York City metropolitan area.

Land-based sports betting is permitted at New York’s four casino-resorts due
to language included in the 2013 constitutional amendment and accompanying
legislation that became effective in 2018 when the federal ban on sports
wagering was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The state legislature
subsequently passed a law to authorize statewide mobile sports betting in
2021, with mobile operations commencing in January 2022.

Market Performance
In 2022, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue
reached a record total of $4.23 billion, up 55.9 percent
from the previous year.

The growth primarily reflected the addition of mobile sports
betting to New York’s commercial gaming market. Between
the launch of online sports wagering on January 8 and the
end of the year, mobile sportsbook operations generated
total revenue of $1.37 billion—making New York by far the
largest sports betting market in the country. Total sports
betting revenue—including from land-based sportsbooks in
New York’s four commercial casino-resorts—totaled $1.37
billion, versus just $23.3 million in 2021.

Revenue from electronic gaming devices at New York’s
commercial casinos and racinos totaled $2.66 billion in
2022, up 4.8 percent against 2021, while revenue from
table games was $203.8 million, up 31.8 percent.

In 2022, the Resorts World New York City racino in
Queens was dethroned from its long-held status as the
most lucrative commercial casino outside of Nevada by
the MGM National Harbor casino-resort in Maryland.
Both Resorts World New York City and Empire City Casino
in Yonkers—the sixth most lucrative commercial casino
outside Nevada in 2022—remain limited to electronic
gaming devices but are expected to apply for licenses to
become full-scale casino-resorts under a 2022 casino
expansion law in order to gain the ability to offer table
games and sports betting.

New York commercial casinos and racinos are taxed at
different rates based on the location of the property and
the type of gaming the property offers.

Racinos, after paying out prizes and deducting vendor and
administrative expenses, retain approximately 45 percent
of their revenue.

Revenue from electronic gaming devices in New York’s four
commercial casino-resorts is taxed between 30 percent
and 37 percent, depending on the region in which the
casino is located. Table game and sports betting revenue
generated by commercial casino-resorts is taxed at 10
percent, regardless of the property’s location.

Revenue from mobile sports betting platforms is taxed at
a rate of 51 percent. Notably, unlike for the other forms of
commercial gaming in New York, the tax rate for mobile
sports betting was not defined by state law; instead,
51 percent was the rate that a group of nine successful
applicants agreed to pay through a competitive licensing
process. Land-based and mobile sportsbook operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied
to wagering handle.

In 2022, New York’s commercial casino gaming industry
generated approximately $1.83 billion in total state gaming
tax revenue, up 67.2 percent versus 2021 when mobile
sports wagering was not yet operational in the state.

In total, mobile sports betting generated tax revenue of
$693.1 million in 2022. The vast majority of the revenue
was retained for New York’s Education Fund, which is used
to provide aid for local school districts across New York. In
accordance with New York’s 2021 mobile sports betting
law, additional tax dollars were set aside to fund problem
gambling education and treatment services, and to fund
a statewide grant program to support sports activities for
underserved youth.

Electronic gaming devices at racinos generated
approximately $970.7 million in total tax revenue for
the state’s Education Fund in 2022, while New York’s
four commercial casino-resorts generated approximately
$170.5 million in gaming tax revenue. Under state law, 80
percent of gaming tax revenue generated by casino-resorts
is used to fund statewide education programs or provide
property tax relief to New York citizens. The remainder is
distributed to local municipal and county governments that
either host or are located near commercial casino-resorts.

Competitive Landscape
Limited to electronic gaming devices, downstate New York’s
established casino gaming facilities have traditionally
competed to varying extents with tribal casino-resorts
in Connecticut and commercial casinos in eastern
Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Looking ahead, however, the competitive landscape for
casino gaming in the New York City area is set to undergo
a fundamental transformation thanks to new legislation
authorizing up to three multibillion-dollar casino-resorts
in the region. Additional competition was also injected

A MERI C A N G A MIN G A S S O CIATIO N

into the downstate New York market in 2022 when a new
casino offering some 1,200 electronic gaming devices was
opened in December in Orange County, about 60 miles
north of New York City, while an established facility in
Nassau County on Long Island received legislative approval
to add a further 1,000 devices to its gaming floor.

Commercial casinos and racinos in parts of upstate New
York directly compete with the state’s 18 tribal casinos
operated by three federally recognized sovereign tribal
nations.

In terms of sports betting, the launch of legal mobile
sports betting in early 2022 means that New York City
residents no longer have to commute to neighboring
New Jersey to place wagers either at the sportsbook at
Meadowlands Racetrack, located some 10 miles from
Manhattan, or via New Jersey’s various mobile sports
betting platforms. Still, New York operators contend that
they remain at a competitive disadvantage, since New
Jersey operators are permitted to offer internet casino
games in addition to sports betting and may be able to
offer a wider range of bonuses and incentives due to New
Jersey’s significantly lower tax rate for sports wagering.

SELECTED STATES: COMMERCIAL SPORTSBOOK GGR

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
In April, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed a state budget law
that included provisions to authorize a licensing process
for the final three commercial casino-resorts permitted
under the New York constitution.

The legislation mandated the revival of an independent
Gaming Facility Location Board to evaluate applications for
casino-resort projects in or around New York City. The three
casinos will be subject to a minimum upfront licensing fee
of $500 million, with the successful applicants selected, in
part, based on the highest gaming tax rate they would be
willing to pay to receive a license. Other selection criteria
include the amount of revenue, employment and economic
development to be generated, the quality of proposed
resort amenities, the proposed construction timetable,
and operator diversity and workforce development plans.
Successful applicants will also be required to demonstrate
sufficient local community support for their projects.

The three-member Gaming Facility Location Board was
named in October, with a request of applications process
to award the three casino licenses scheduled to begin in
early January 2023.

Separately, Gov. Hochul signed a bill in December to
authorize the Jake’s 58 Hotel & Casino in Nassau County
to double the number of electronic gaming devices it is
permitted to offer, up to a maximum of 2,000 devices.
Located on densely populated Long Island, electronic
gaming devices at the Jake’s 58 casino have historically
generated twice as much revenue per day as the statewide
average.

Fantasy Sports
In March, the New York Court of Appeals resolved a
longstanding legal dispute by finding a 2016 law that
regulated fantasy sports contests to be constitutional.

A state constitutional amendment and voter referendum
is generally required to authorize new forms of gambling
in New York and plaintiffs argued that the 2016 fantasy
sports law was illegitimate since a constitutional change
was not approved by voters.

In its 4–3 ruling, a panel of New York Court of Appeals
judges ruled that a constitutional amendment was not
required for fantasy sports, since the state’s prohibitions
on gambling do not apply to skill-based competitions in
which participants exercise substantial influence over the
outcome.

In April, the New York Senate’s Committee on Racing,

bills to increase the number of mobile sports betting

to mobile sports betting, authorize fixed-odds wagering on
horse races, and establish a state problem gambling task

As regulators and casino operators prepared for the

launch of legal sports betting in Ohio, total statewide

commercial casino gaming revenue from traditional

electronic gaming devices and table games increased

by 1.0 percent to a record $2.33 billion in 2022.

Market Overview
Ohio offers commercial casino gaming at four casino-resorts, each of which
operates electronic gaming devices and table games, and at seven racinos,
which only offer electronic gaming devices. The land-based casinos are
regulated by the Ohio Casino Control Commission while the racinos are
regulated by the Ohio Lottery Commission.

In 2009, Ohio voters approved a ballot initiative authorizing commercial
casinos in the state’s four largest cities of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and
Toledo. Two years later, an executive order approved electronic gaming devices
(specifically video lottery terminals, or VLTs) at established Ohio racetracks.
Racinos are limited to a maximum of 2,500 electronic gaming devices each,
half the statutory limit applied to Ohio’s casino properties.

The state legislature approved a bill in December 2021 to authorize land-based
sports wagering at commercial casinos and racinos, at major professional sports
arenas, and via kiosks in retail locations licensed to serve alcohol. Statewide
online sports betting was also legalized under the same law. Both online and
land-based sports wagering were scheduled to launch on January 1, 2023, per
a deadline established by the Ohio Casino Control Commission.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices
at casinos and racinos was $2.03 billion, up 0.4 percent
versus 2021, while table game revenue at casinos was
$303.7 million, up 5.2 percent.

As reflected in the table game performance, Ohio’s four
casino-resorts located in the downtown areas of the
state’s major cities saw stronger revenue growth in 2022
compared with Ohio’s more suburban racino properties.

The four casinos reported combined casino gaming
revenue of $1.01 billion, up 7.3 percent against 2021.
Ohio’s 11 racinos reported total electronic gaming device
revenue of $1.33 billion, up less than 0.1 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Ohio levies a 33 percent tax on casinos’ gross gaming
revenue, while racinos pay a slightly higher 33.5 percent
effective tax rate on their revenue from electronic gaming
devices.

In 2022, casinos and racinos generated total gaming tax
revenue of $781.0 million, up 2.8 percent from the prior
year. Casinos accounted for approximately $331.7 million
of the total, while electronic gaming devices at racinos
generated about $449 million.

Roughly 50 percent of casino tax revenue is distributed
to Ohio’s 88 county governments to support local
budgetary needs, including law enforcement, infrastructure

improvements and other public services. Another 34
percent is earmarked for the Ohio Student Fund, which
distributes dollars to all school districts, while 5 percent
is returned to the host cities where casinos are located.
The remaining funds are used to treat problem gambling
and cover the costs of the agencies that regulate gaming in
Ohio.

Under Ohio law, all racino gaming tax revenue must be
used to fund state education programs. Accordingly, racino
tax revenue flows into the Lottery Profits Education Fund,
which supports primary and secondary schools in Ohio.

Competitive Landscape
In addition to fierce competition among the casinos and
racinos within the state, various Ohio casino gaming
properties also compete for patrons with gaming venues
located in neighboring markets.

Casinos and racinos in the Cincinnati area compete with
a trio of riverboat casinos stationed on the Indiana side of
the Ohio River and with two Kentucky racetrack facilities
that offer electronic gaming devices based on historical
horse races. In July 2022, the Kentucky Horse Racing
Commission awarded a license for an additional gaming
facility featuring historical horse racing devices to be
located in the town of Ashland, on the Ohio state line.

Elsewhere, three West Virginia racinos and one
Pennsylvania racino are also located near Ohio’s eastern
border and draw customers from the state.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
Implementation of the December 2021 state law that
authorized land-based and online sports betting was the
chief focus of Ohio gaming regulators in 2022.

In June, the Ohio Casino Control Commission announced
that sports betting would launch on January 1, 2023—the
latest permissible date under the state’s sports wagering
statute. In order to meet that launch date, prospective
online and land-based sportsbook operators and suppliers
were required to submit license applications during
specific windows opened in June, July and August and
then meet various other regulatory deadlines in order to
give officials sufficient time to vet their equipment, internal
policies and key staff.

Reflecting the breadth of Ohio’s sports betting law, the
casino commission received 23 license applications
to operate mobile sports betting platforms and 27
applications to operate land-based sportsbooks at casinos,
racinos, sports stadiums and other venues. A further seven

companies submitted applications to operate networks
of sports wagering kiosks at bars and other non-gaming
locations.

In May, the Ohio Casino Control Commission adopted a
final set of regulations to govern sports wagering license
applications and operations. An official catalog of approved
wagering events was approved by the commission in
November.

In advance of launching sports betting operations, the
commission permitted license applicants to advertise and
pre-register customers in the state, provided they abided
by regulations related to advertising that include not

targeting those aged under 21 or inaccurately describing
the terms of promotional offers.

Taxation
In June, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a tax reform
bill amending a technical error in the state’s original sports
wagering law.

Under the original law, Ohio sports betting operators would
have been required to pay sports betting taxes on the same
daily basis as the state’s land-based casinos. The new
legislation changed the law to instead require tax payments
on a monthly basis, the same as other states with legal
sports wagering.

OKLAHOMA

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $150.9 million, an all-time high for

Oklahoma’s two racinos.

Market Overview
Oklahoma offers commercial casino gaming at two racinos, which are regulated
by the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission. The racinos may only operate
electronic gaming devices, with a maximum of 750 devices permitted at
Remington Park in Oklahoma City and 250 machines at Cherokee Casino Will
Rogers Downs in Claremore.

The racinos were first authorized in 2004, when Oklahoma voters also ratified
the State-Tribal Gaming Act, which established a regulatory framework for tribal
gaming in the state.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$150.9 million, up 3.5 percent from 2021.

The overall growth was driven by performance of the larger of Oklahoma’s two
commercial racinos. Remington Park, which is located in the heart of Oklahoma
City and operated by a commercial subsidiary of the Chickasaw Nation of
Oklahoma, reported electronic gaming device revenue of $129.3 million, up 4.6
percent versus the previous year.

In contrast, revenue from electronic gaming devices at Cherokee Casino Will
Rogers Downs, owned by the Cherokee Nation, was $21.6 million, down
approximately 2.5 percent.

While Oklahoma borders no less than five states that
offer commercial casino gaming, the primary competitive
threat to the state’s gaming market comes from potential
legalization in Texas, where state lawmakers are poised to
reconsider legislative proposals related to casino expansion
during their 2023 biennial session.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Tribal Gaming
Litigation over the status of tribal gaming compacts in
Oklahoma continued in 2022.

In November, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) continued a legal
challenge to uphold new compacts he signed with four
Native American tribes in 2020 that included offering
the Otoe-Missouria Tribe, Comanche Nation, United
Keetoowah Band of the Cherokees and Kialegee Tribal
Town the authority to offer sports wagering on tribal lands.

The lawsuit filed in federal court claimed the compacts
were effective since they were legally approved by the
federal government, even though the Oklahoma Supreme
Court later found them to be invalid because sports betting
was not a form of gaming that had been authorized by the
state legislature.

Stitt, who was re-elected to a second term in November,
has called for tribes to pay the state a higher share of
their casino gaming revenue and previously unsuccessfully
argued that Oklahoma’s original tribal gaming compacts
from 2004 expired at the end of their first 15-year term.

Sports Betting
In March, a bill to authorize sports betting in Oklahoma
tribal casinos, subject to approval of the requisite
amendments to tribal-state gaming compacts, was passed
by the budget and appropriations committee in the
Oklahoma House of Representatives.

The bill was however not brought up for a vote on the
House floor before lawmakers adjourned their 2022
session.

Oklahoma

Gaming Tax Distribution
Oklahoma taxes commercial casino revenue at different
rates based on the amount of revenue generated. Rates
range in a graduated scale from 35 percent on revenue up
to $10 million, to 50 percent on revenue of more than $70
million.

In 2022, Oklahoma racinos paid approximately $68.7
million in total gaming taxes, an increase of 3.9 percent
relative to the previous year.

Commercial gaming tax revenue is shared between the
state government and Oklahoma’s horse racing industry.
Approximately $31.4 million was remitted to the state in
2022 and used to fund state education initiatives, as well
as for general budgetary purposes.

In addition, racinos distributed roughly $36.5 million to
help subsidize horse racing purses, breeding programs and
other horse racing industry expenses.

Competitive Landscape
Oklahoma’s two racinos are overshadowed by the state’s
140 tribal casinos, which are authorized to offer table
games, in addition to electronic gaming devices. During
the state’s 2022 fiscal year ending June 30, Oklahoma
tribal casinos generated an estimated $3.19 billion in
casino gaming revenue, exclusive of revenue from popular
electronic bingo devices.

OREGON

The Oregon Lottery reported a 62.9 percent increase

in total sports betting revenue, rising to $49.5 million

in 2022, a year that saw the lottery transition to a

DraftKings-operated online betting platform.

Market Overview
Oregon has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through the
Oregon Lottery and its contracted partner.

A limited form of sports betting was first launched by the Oregon Lottery in
1989, granting the state a partial exemption from the 1992 federal law that
prohibited expanded sports wagering. Although sports betting was discontinued
in 2007, the Oregon Lottery revived the offering in 2019 and expanded it to
include single-event wagering on all professional sports. The Oregon Lottery’s
own sportsbook product was discontinued in January 2022 after the lottery
executed a contract with DraftKings to market and operate sports wagering on
its behalf.

There is no specific state law that regulates sports betting in Oregon; instead,
it is considered to fall under the broader definition of lottery games the state
lottery is authorized to offer.

Market Performance
In 2022, total commercial sports betting revenue in Oregon was $49.5 million,
up 62.9 percent from the previous year, when the Oregon Lottery directly
operated sports wagering. DraftKings launched its platform in the state in
January 2022.

As the Oregon Lottery has yet to launch any form of retail sports wagering, all
revenue generated in 2022 was derived from online sports betting.

Oregon

Notably, due to state policy, the Oregon Lottery and
DraftKings remain unable to offer wagers on any collegiate
sports. Although New Jersey and several other states
prohibit wagers on games involving in-state college teams,
DraftKings’ Oregon sportsbook is the only online sports
betting platform unable to offer bets on any college sports.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Sports betting operated by the Oregon Lottery is not
subject to taxation per se; instead, the lottery receives an
undisclosed percentage of revenue earned by DraftKings
following the deduction of certain authorized expenses,
including marketing costs. As sports betting is operated
via the state lottery, it is not subject to the 0.25 percent
federal excise tax typically applied to commercial
operators’ wagering handle.

In 2022, sports betting generated estimated state tax
revenue of approximately $19.5 million, up 1.4 percent on
the prior year.

In accordance with state law, the Oregon Lottery transfers
its profits to specific programs as determined by the state
legislature. Programs funded by Oregon Lottery profits
include education and veterans services, state parks,
conservation projects and economic-growth initiatives.

Competitive Landscape
The Oregon Lottery faces competition for sports bettors
from sportsbook operations at several tribal casinos within
the state. Certain Oregon Indian tribes are permitted to
operate sports betting in their tribal casinos because of
language in their tribal-state gaming compacts which
permits the tribes to offer any form of casino gaming that
has already been approved in Nevada. Sports betting is
also available at tribal casinos in neighboring Washington.

In addition to sports betting and the state’s 10 tribal
casinos, Oregon’s gaming market includes electronic
gaming devices operated by the Oregon Lottery at bars and
other retail locations. Betting on horse racing is also legal.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Regulatory Reform
In April, the leaders of the Oregon House and Senate
agreed to establish an interim study committee to
review the state’s gaming landscape and make policy
recommendations for potential regulatory reforms prior to
the 2023 legislative session.

After a series of six public meetings, the Joint Interim
Committee on Gambling Regulation submitted its report
in December, recommending that a permanent oversight
committee be formed to consider legislative matters
related to all forms of gaming in Oregon.

The eight-member committee also recommended that
Oregon lawmakers refrain from approving any further
expansion of commercial gaming until the legislature has
the opportunity to complete a more comprehensive study
of the state’s gaming market.

Horse Racing
In February, the Oregon Department of Justice published
a legal opinion finding that the operation of electronic
gaming devices based on the outcome of previously
run horse races would violate the state’s constitutional
prohibitions on commercial gaming.

The opinion was requested by the Oregon Racing
Commission as part of its consideration of a licensing
application for a racetrack operation near the state’s
southern border with California.

The Attorney General’s opinion found that because players
would not exercise significant skill in determining the
outcome of so-called historical horse racing devices, the
games would be considered lotteries and the Oregon state
constitution exclusively allows the state to conduct lottery
games outside of tribal lands.

Historical horse racing devices are permitted under a state
law passed by the Oregon legislature and were formerly
offered at the now shuttered Portland Meadows racetrack.

PENNSYLVANIA

Growth in both land-based and interactive casino

revenue saw Pennsylvania’s commercial casino gaming

industry achieve record revenue of $5.34 billion in

2022, an increase of 10.6 percent on the prior year.

Market Overview
Pennsylvania offers commercial casino gaming at 10 land-based casinos and six
racinos, which are authorized to operate electronic gaming devices, table games
and sports betting. The properties are regulated by the Pennsylvania Gaming
Control Board (PGCB).

In 2004, the Pennsylvania legislature approved the Horse Development
and Gaming Act, which authorized electronic gaming devices at racetracks,
standalone casinos, and three smaller casino-resorts. Table games were
approved by the legislature in 2010. In 2017, a wide-ranging gaming expansion
bill authorized up to ten additional “satellite” or mini-casinos, each limited to a
maximum of 750 electronic gaming devices and 40 table games.

In addition, the 2017 legislation authorized Pennsylvania commercial casinos to
apply for separate licenses to offer land-based and online sports betting as well
as iGaming via affiliated online casino platforms. At the end of 2022, a total of
18 internet casinos and 13 online sportsbooks were operational in Pennsylvania.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record $5.34
billion, up 10.6 percent from the previous year.

The Pennsylvania market reported revenue growth from both traditional land-
based casino gaming as well as from the more growing iGaming and sports
wagering segments.

Pennsylvania

Bolstered by the recent openings of a major new casino-
resort in Philadelphia and several smaller satellite casino
properties, Pennsylvania commercial casinos reported
record statewide land-based casino gaming revenue of
$3.38 billion, up 5.3 percent from 2021.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was
$2.39 billion, up 4.5 percent, while table game revenue
was $990.6 million, up 7.1 percent.

Sports betting revenue is subject to a 36 percent
effective tax rate, which includes a two percent tax for
local municipalities and is applied after deduction of
promotional free bets offered to players. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

Total casino gaming tax revenue for the year was
approximately $2.21 billion, up 9.5 percent from 2021.

Internet gaming revenue totaled $1.36 billion, up 22.6
percent against the previous year. Total statewide sports
betting revenue was $597.4 million, up 18.2 percent.
Online sports betting revenue grew by approximately 21.6
percent and accounted for $547.6 million of the statewide
total, more than offsetting a 9.6 percent drop in land-
based sports betting revenue to $49.7 million.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Pennsylvania land-based commercial casinos and racinos
pay a 54 percent tax rate on electronic gaming device
revenue, a 16 percent tax rate on table game revenue, and
a 34 percent tax rate on revenue from electronic versions
of table games.

Internet gaming revenue is taxed at the same headline
rates of either 54 or 16 percent, depending on whether
the online casino game in question simulates an electronic
gaming device or a table game.

The state’s share of gaming tax revenue in Pennsylvania is
primarily used to reduce school taxes paid by Pennsylvania
property owners, with additional allocations for local law
enforcement grants and responsible gaming programs.
In 2022, the state’s share of direct gaming tax revenue
amounted to approximately $1.58 billion.

Approximately $202.7 million was distributed to
Pennsylvania’s horse racing industry in 2022, while
remaining tax payments were allocated to an economic
development and tourism fund, to county governments and
to the municipalities that host casinos and racinos.

Competitive Landscape
Pennsylvania’s casinos operate at the intersection of the
fiercely competitive Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.
Individual Pennsylvania casinos compete against rival
properties in Delaware and northern Maryland to the
south; New York City and Atlantic City to the east; Ohio to
the west; and West Virginia to the southwest.

Following the opening of the Live! Casino Hotel
Philadelphia casino in late 2020 and three satellite casino
facilities across the state the following year, the state’s
land-based casino market is set for additional competition
with the opening of at least two additional satellite casinos
planned for different parts of central Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania commercial casinos also face a degree of
competition from the operation of lawful electronic gaming
devices (VGTs) at truck stops. As authorized under the
state’s 2017 gaming expansion law, truck stops meeting a
certain set of criteria are eligible to install up to five VGTs
on their premises. In 2022, electronic gaming devices
operational at a total of 66 truck stops across the state
generated approximately $41.2 million in gaming revenue.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion
In January, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board
formally awarded the state’s fourth so-called Category
4 casino license for a satellite casino project sited in
Shippensburg Township in Cumberland County.

The owner of Pennsylvania’s most lucrative land-based
casino—Parx Casino—won an auction to acquire the
license in 2018 but the approval process was delayed as a
new site for the project was chosen and regulators received
additional public input on the proposal. The casino was
scheduled to open in early 2023.

Pennsylvania’s 2017 gaming expansion law authorized the
control board to auction off up to 10 Category 4 licenses
subject to certain geographic restrictions and a minimum
starting bid of $7.5 million. As of the end of 2022, the
board had allocated four of the 10 licenses to successful
bidders, with a fifth license application for a casino project
in Centre County still undergoing the regulatory approval
process.

Cybersecurity
In July, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board issued
new guidance to operators of iGaming and mobile sports
betting platforms requiring them to implement multi-factor
authentication for all patron accounts prior to the end of
the year.

Among other things, the guidance requires players to
authenticate their accounts using a second factor other
than their password for any new device being used, or
at least once every 14 days for known devices. Players
must also be offered the option to use multi-factor
authentication for every login.

Pennsylvania’s multi-factor authentication requirement
mirrored similar guidance that took effect for iGaming and
online sports betting in New Jersey in July.

RHODE ISLAND

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue increased by 15.8 percent to $688.2 million as

Rhode Island’s two land-based casinos battled regional

competition and the state lottery reported strong

growth in online sports betting.

Market Overview
Rhode Island offers commercial casino gaming at two casinos operated under
the authority of the Rhode Island Lottery.

In 1992, the Rhode Island legislature passed a bill permitting electronic gaming
devices at the state’s two pari-mutuel wagering venues. In 2012, state voters
approved the addition of table games at Twin River Casino in Lincoln. In 2016,
voters approved a ballot measure permitting the struggling Newport Grand
Casino to relocate to the town of Tiverton, on the Massachusetts border. The
measure also authorized the relocated casino to offer table games.

In June 2018, the legislature passed a bill authorizing the state lottery to
operate sports betting at both commercial casinos. Subsequent legislation the
following year authorized online sports betting.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $688.2
million, up 15.8 percent from 2021.

Total revenue from electronic gaming devices was $508.8 million, an increase
of 14.6 percent from the previous year, while revenue from table games was
$130.2 million, up 16.7 percent. While higher than the previous two years,
the state’s overall revenue of $638.9 million from traditional casino games
continued to lag 2018 and 2019 revenue levels when the two Rhode Island
casinos did not face competition from the Encore Boston Harbor casino-resort
in Massachusetts.

partners of the state lottery (32 percent) and the casino
hosting the sportsbook operation (17 percent). In addition,
the host communities of Lincoln and Tiverton each receive
an annual payment of $100,000.

In 2022, commercial casino gaming generated $345.6
million in total tax revenue for Rhode Island’s General
Fund, up 15.1 percent versus the previous year.

The General Fund is appropriated annually at the direction
of the legislature and is used to pay for various state
services, including education, public safety programs and
healthcare.

A small fraction of gaming tax revenue is also remitted
annually to the towns of Lincoln and Tiverton as well as to
the Narragansett Indian Tribe.

Competitive Landscape
Rhode Island’s commercial casinos compete directly with
Plainridge Park Casino in Massachusetts, which is just
20 miles from Providence, as well as the Foxwoods and
Mohegan Sun tribal casinos in southeastern Connecticut.
Since mid-2019, New England casinos have faced a
substantial increase in competition for players from the
Greater Boston area in the form of the Encore Boston
Harbor casino-resort, located in Everett, Massachusetts.

A fourth Massachusetts casino is also authorized under
a 2011 gaming law for the state’s southeastern region
that borders Rhode Island. However, a planned tribal
casino-resort has been stalled by legal challenges and
Massachusetts regulators have to date declined to license
an alternative commercial casino in the region.

Through the end of 2022, Rhode Island’s two commercial
casino-resorts enjoyed a competitive advantage over
counterparts in Massachusetts by virtue of being able
to offer sports betting in addition to electronic gaming
devices and table games. That advantage will come to an
end, however, after Massachusetts adopted legislation in
2022 to permit land-based sports wagering at its casinos
and racing facilities, as well as via mobile platforms on a
statewide basis. .

Rhode Island

Sports betting revenue in Rhode Island amounted to
$49.3 million in 2022, up 27.2 percent against the prior
year. Online sports betting accounted for approximately
$28.8 million—or 58.5 percent—of the total, a lower
proportion than in most other states with legal mobile
sports wagering. Online sports betting revenue was up
41.9 percent on a year-over-year basis. Rhode Island’s two
commercial casinos reported land-based sports betting
revenue of $20.5 million, up roughly 10.8 percent.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Rhode Island’s Bally’s Twin River Lincoln and Bally’s
Tiverton commercial casinos retain roughly 26 percent to
28.85 percent of their revenue from electronic gaming
devices, depending on each facility’s operating contract
and state regulation. An additional annual allowance
is made for certain marketing expenses. The state’s
overall take of electronic gaming device revenue, after
administrative and technology expenses are deducted, is
about 60 percent.

By contrast, table game revenue is taxed at a rate of
either 17 or 19 percent depending on each casino’s total
net revenue in relation to the previous fiscal year. If a
property’s revenue is up from the prior year it pays an
additional two percent.

Sports betting is taxed at an effective rate of 51 percent
with the remaining amount split between the operating

SOUTH DAKOTA

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue fell by 2.2 percent to $142.9 million, as a full

year of revenue from sports betting could not offset

declines in electronic gaming device and table game

revenue at commercial casinos in Deadwood.

Market Overview
South Dakota offers commercial casino gaming at 21 locations exclusively
within the city limits of historic Deadwood, located on the edge of the Black
Hills National Forest near the Wyoming and Montana borders.

The casinos can operate electronic gaming devices, table games and sports
betting. They are regulated by the South Dakota Commission on Gaming.

Commercial casino gaming was first approved by South Dakota voters in a 1988
statewide referendum. Sports betting received voter approval in 2020 and
began in 2021 after the state legislature passed a new law to implement the
referendum.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $142.9
million. While that was the state’s second highest ever gaming revenue total, the
figure was down 2.2 percent on the record haul reported in 2021.

Total revenue from electronic gaming devices was $126.0 million, down 2.3
percent versus the previous year. Table game revenue was $16.0 million, down
4.8 percent.

Reflecting a first full year of operations after South Dakota’s first sportsbooks
opened in September 2021, Deadwood casinos reported sports betting revenue
of approximately $871,500 in 2022, more than tripling the previous year’s total.

South Dakota

Gaming Tax Distribution
South Dakota applies a 9 percent tax on all commercial
casino gaming revenue, including revenue sports betting.
In addition, a gaming device tax is applied to both table
games and electronic gaming devices, in the amount of
$2,000 per unit per year. The sportsbook operations of
Deadwood casinos are also subject to a 0.25 percent
federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, commercial casinos in South Dakota generated
total gaming tax revenue of approximately $17.4 million,
down 1.1 percent against the previous year.

Of the 9 percent of gaming revenue collected, 1 percent
is distributed to South Dakota’s General Fund, and
the remaining 8 percent is divided between the state’s
Gaming Commission Fund, the South Dakota Department
of Tourism and Lawrence County, where Deadwood is
located.

The Gaming Commission Fund provides up to $6.8 million
annually to the City of Deadwood, and up to $100,000
to the State Historical Preservation Grant and Loan
Fund, with all remaining funds going to the state General
Fund, Lawrence County municipalities and schools,
and Deadwood historic preservation. In addition, the
Commission Fund is authorized to provide up to $30,000
annually for state gambling addiction programs.

Competitive Landscape
With almost two dozen casinos in Deadwood and no major
population center within hundreds of miles, South Dakota
relies heavily on tourists to patronize the historic town’s
commercial casinos. The wider South Dakota gaming
market also includes 11 tribal casinos spread across the
state, as well as a network of over 10,200 electronic
gaming devices operated by the South Dakota Lottery at
nearly 1,400 retail locations, such as bars and taverns.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming
In June, the South Dakota Commission on Gaming
approved a series of amendments to the state’s casino
gaming regulations, including introducing several new
requirements related to responsible gaming.

The new regulations required Deadwood’s commercial
casino operators to offer a self-exclusion plan to enable
at-risk patrons to prevent themselves from gambling.
Casino operators were also obligated to provide all players
with responsible gaming information, including details
about self-exclusion and other available player protection
measures, at the patron’s request.

Other regulatory changes approved by the commission
addressed matters related to casino surveillance, integrity
reporting and parlay sports betting.

Sports Betting
After enacting a law in 2021 to authorize sports wagering
at Deadwood commercial casinos, South Dakota
lawmakers considered further legislation in 2022 to
expand the state’s nascent sports betting market.

In February, the state Senate narrowly passed a proposed
constitutional amendment to authorize statewide mobile
sports betting offered by platforms affiliated with licensed
casinos and operating via servers located within Deadwood
city limits.

The bill died, however, when House lawmakers declined to
bring it up for a vote before the 2022 legislative session
adjourned. Had the measure been passed by the full
legislature, South Dakota voters would have been asked
to approve the constitutional amendment via a statewide
referendum.

TENNESSEE

In 2022, Tennessee reported total online sports betting

revenue of $379.4 million, an increase of 58.2 percent

from the previous year.

Tennessee has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through
online sportsbook operators subject to regulation by the Tennessee Sports
Wagering Advisory Council.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

GROSS SPORTS BETTING REVENUE 2022
$379.4M

A state law passed in 2019 authorizes commercial gaming operators to apply for
an unlimited number of licenses to offer online sports betting. Tennessee’s law
was notable for being the first in the U.S. to limit sports wagering exclusively to
online platforms, with no retail sportsbook operations permitted.

SPORT BETTING TAX REVENUE 2022

Legal sports betting began in November 2020. At the end of 2022, 11 online
sports betting platforms were available to consumers.

Market Performance
In 2022, total sports betting revenue in Tennessee was $379.4 million, an
increase of 58.2 percent on the previous year.

The total made Tennessee the tenth largest sports betting market in the U.S. in
2022, or the eight largest for mobile sports wagering.

Tennessee

In 2022, sports betting generated total state tax revenue
of approximately $68.1 million, up 73.2 percent from the
previous year.

Of that amount, approximately $54.4 million was
distributed to the Tennessee Lottery’s education fund
used to support education programs across the state.
Some $10.2 million was allocated to local governments
for infrastructure projects, with the remainder set aside for
mental health and problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape
Tennessee faces a degree of regional competition
from sports betting operations available in neighboring
states. Legal sports betting is available at one Arkansas
commercial casino and at several Mississippi casinos
in the Tunica/Lula market that attract patrons from the
Greater Memphis area. Since March 2022, mobile sports
betting is also available on a statewide basis in Arkansas.

Online sports betting is also offered in Virginia, where one
land-based casino featuring a retail sportsbook is under
development in the city of Bristol on the Tennessee border.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In March, the Tennessee Sports Wagering Advisory Council
voted to formally adopt its revised regulations applicable to
online sports betting in the state.

The council was empowered by a 2021 state law to assume
primary regulatory authority for sports wagering effective
January 1, 2022, having initially served in a more advisory
capacity to the board of the Tennessee Education Lottery.

The council’s regulations were largely developed through a
series of rulemaking hearings in late 2021 and rules were
brought into effect on an emergency basis in December.
The permanent rules approved after further hearings in
March became fully effective in June.

The Sports Wagering Advisory Council’s regulations
included several notable differences from those originally
implemented by the Tennessee Lottery in 2020. Among
other changes, the new rules allow sports betting operators
to cancel wagers placed in the case of an obvious error
by the sportsbook and no longer require operators to
submit advertising materials for advance approval prior to
dissemination.

The regulations did, however, retain a controversial
regulatory requirement for online sports betting operators
to pay out no more than 90 percent of the total amount
wagered on their platforms over the course of a year,
ensuring a minimum hold of at least 10 percent and
therefore state tax revenue equivalent to a minimum of
2 percent of the amounts wagered. The council’s rules
instead included a provision allowing operators to “cure”
a violation of the provision by making additional tax
payments to the state if their hold percentage drops below
10 percent for a calendar year.

In another policy development, the Tennessee Sports
Wagering Advisory Council in June notified operators of
a change in how monthly taxes on sports betting revenue
would be assessed. Specifically, the new guidance
required operators to report winnings derived from a wider
range of bonuses and promotions offered to players as part
of their taxable gross revenue. The reporting change led to
a notable increase in monthly state tax collections through
the second half of the year.

Also in 2020, Virginia legislators approved a separate law authorizing qualified
sports betting operators to obtain permits to offer online sports wagering across
the state. State law allows for up to 19 permits to be awarded, with seven of
them reserved for the designated partners of Virginia’s land-based casinos or
certain professional sports teams but a further 12 available to other operators.
Online sports betting went live in January 2021 and by the end of 2022, 14
online sportsbook platforms were operational in Virginia.

Both land-based casino gaming and mobile sports betting are subject to
regulation by the Virginia Lottery Board.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue amounted to
$563.2 million, almost double a 2021 total of $285.9 million that was derived
exclusively from mobile sports betting.

Hard Rock International’s Bristol Casino reported
total casino gaming revenue of $82.0 million in
the five-and-a-half month period after its opening
in July. Electronic gaming devices accounted for
$66.8 million—or approximately 81.5 percent—
of that total. Table game revenue was $15.2
million.

Meanwhile, Virginia’s online sports betting
operators reported total gross sports wagering
revenue of $481.2 million, up 68.3 percent from
the prior year.

That revenue total saw Virginia surpass Nevada,
Indiana and Michigan to become the sixth largest

Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.
Federal excise payments are also deductible from revenue

In 2022, Virginia generated total state gaming tax revenue
of approximately $66.5 million—more than three times

Under state law, tax revenue generated by land-based
casino gaming is collected in Virginia’s Gaming Proceeds
Fund and then redistributed to various beneficiaries.
Between six and eight percent of casino revenue is
returned to the casino’s host city, depending on the
amount of revenue generated, with 0.8 percent of revenue
appropriated for problem gambling treatment and support
and a further 0.2 percent distributed to a state fund that
supports those suffering from family violence and trauma.
The remainder is applied to Virginia’s General Fund and
appropriated by the state legislature.

The vast majority of sports betting tax revenue is
allocated to Virginia’s General Fund, with 2.5 percent of
total revenue set aside for the state’s Problem Gambling
Treatment and Support Fund.

Competitive Landscape
After the opening of the state’s first temporary casino
facility in 2022, Virginia’s land-based casino gaming
market is set to be transformed in future years as its
casino-resort industry is built out.

In addition to a Hard Rock-branded permanent casino-
resort in Bristol, casino projects in the cities of Danville,
Norfolk and Portsmouth are all due to open, though
each remained in varying stages of the licensing and
development process at the end of 2022.

Rivers Casino Portsmouth was poised to open the
state’s first full casino-resort in early 2023, having been
granted a gaming license by the Virginia Lottery Board in
November. A fifth land-based casino in the state capital of
Richmond is also authorized under state law, although that
project would require local voter approval via a citywide
referendum.

Once fully operational, Virginia’s land-based casinos will
be eligible to operate retail sportsbooks, in addition to
electronic gaming devices and table games.

In terms of sports betting, Virginia’s online sportsbook
platforms face extra competition for customers in the
populous greater Washington D.C. region following the
launch of mobile sports wagering in neighboring Maryland
in November 2022. Virginia operators also compete with
retail sportsbooks at Maryland land-based casinos and
other venues. Further regional competition comes from
retail and limited mobile sports betting available at the
District of Columbia’s major sports arenas, as well as from
the DC Lottery’s sports betting program.

In addition to land-based casinos and sports betting,
Virginia’s broader gaming market includes a racetrack
and affiliated off-track betting facilities that are eligible
to offer electronic gaming devices based on the outcome
of historical horse races. The Virginia Lottery also offers a
range of online lottery games.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In June, Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) signed a state budget
law that included changes to the tax regime applicable to
online sports betting operators in Virginia.

Under the state’s original legislation from 2020, operators
were permitted to deduct an unlimited amount of bonuses,
free bets and other promotions from their monthly taxable
revenue. The 2022 budget amended the sports betting law
to enable operators to deduct bonuses and promotions only
during their first 12 months of operations in the state, with
revenue won as a result of free bets awarded to patrons
fully taxable after that point.

Expansion
Another provision in the state budget law required the city
of Richmond to wait until at least November 2023 before
holding a second local referendum on casino expansion.

Richmond residents narrowly rejected an initial casino
referendum held in November 2021. The state budget law
specified that the Virginia Lottery Board could not award a
casino license for any Richmond project approved before
2023.

The budget also authorized an independent study on the
feasibility of nearby Petersburg as an alternative location to

Richmond for Virginia’s fifth and final land-based casino.
An October 2022 report produced for Virginia’s Joint
Legislative Audit & Review Commission found that local
demand was sufficient for two casinos in Richmond and
Petersburg to co-exist, although allowing a Petersburg
casino would cannibalize revenue from other Virginia
casino-resorts and from historical horse racing operations.

Illegal Gaming
Virginia lawmakers took several actions in 2022 to tackle
illegal gaming operations in the state.

Language included in the state’s annual budget law signed
in June tightened a prior prohibition on so-called skill
game devices that was enacted in 2021, by specifying that
the ban would apply to devices paying out cash equivalents
as prizes, or to devices allowing players to win free games
by paying more money.

Enforcement of Virginia’s initial 2021 ban on unregulated
gaming devices remained on hold at the end of 2022, as a
result of a court challenge filed by the owner of a chain of
convenience stores that host the devices.

In April, Gov. Youngkin also signed separate bills to
impose a civil penalty of $25,000 on persons facilitating
the operation of illegal gaming devices in Virginia, and to
establish a gaming enforcement coordinator within the
state police department.

WEST VIRGINIA

In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $756.3 million, up 13.2 percent, as West

Virginia operators reported growth in both traditional

and online casino revenue but a decline in revenue

from land-based sports betting.

Market Overview
West Virginia offers commercial casino gaming at four racinos and one land-
based casino. Each of the five land-based venues operates electronic gaming
devices, table games and sports betting under the authority of the West Virginia
Lottery Commission.

The state authorized commercial casino gaming in 1994 when the West Virginia
legislature endorsed the operation of electronic gaming devices at licensed
racetracks, subject to local approval. Legislation allowing racinos to add table
games was approved in 2007. In 2008, voters approved casino gaming at The
Greenbrier historic hotel and legislators authorized table games at the property
the following year.

Anticipating a favorable ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a
federal ban, the state legislature passed a bill in March 2018 legalizing land-
based and online sports betting. In 2019, further legislation was passed to
authorize iGaming through online casino platforms partnering with the state’s
casinos and racinos. At the close of 2022, a total of nine online sportsbooks
and seven internet casinos were operational.

Market Performance
In 2022, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $756.3
million, up 13.2 percent on the prior year. The total was West Virginia’s highest
since 2013 and reflected strong growth in the state’s iGaming market in
particular.

West Virginia

Total revenue from iGaming was $112.6 million, up 84.9
percent versus 2021. Revenue from traditional electronic
gaming devices in casinos was $485.7 million, up 5.9
percent on the prior year, while total table game revenue
was $107.2 million, up 4.3 percent.

Total sports betting revenue amounted to $50.9 million in
2022, an increase of 11.2 percent. Online sports betting
accounted for an estimated $41.6 million—or roughly
81.8 percent—of total revenue, as land-based sports
wagering revenue fell by approximately 45 percent to an
estimated $9.2 million, in part due to increased cross-
border competition from newly launched sportsbooks at
land-based casinos in neighboring Maryland.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from electronic gaming devices at West Virginia’s
five casino properties is subject to an effective tax rate of
53.5 percent, while table games are taxed at 35 percent.

The tax rate for iGaming is 15 percent, with sports betting
subject to a state tax of 10 percent of revenue. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2022, West Virginia’s commercial casinos and affiliated
online sports betting and iGaming platforms generated total

Internet gaming and sports wagering accounted for more
than 20 percent of total statewide commercial casino
gaming revenue in West Virginia in 2022 and helped the
market to reach its highest overall revenue total since the
expansion of neighboring Maryland’s casino gaming market
in 2013.

gaming tax revenue of approximately $299.0 million, an
increase of 9.8 percent from the prior year.

The majority of gaming tax revenue is remitted to the
state government, including to funds associated with the
West Virginia Lottery. Lottery funds are allocated to the
state’s public schools, tourism promotion, state parks
and services for senior citizens. County and municipal
governments also receive a small percentage of gaming
tax proceeds, as do West Virginia’s horse and greyhound
racing industries.

Taxes collected from sports betting are placed in the West
Virginia Lottery Sports Wagering Fund, which distributes
the first $15 million to the State Lottery Fund before
remaining taxes are used to help support health-insurance
programs for public sector employees.

Internet gaming taxes are similarly deposited into the
West Virginia Lottery Interactive Wagering Fund. The fund
distributes annual tax profits to the State Lottery Fund,
following deductions for regulatory costs and contributions
to the pensions of West Virginia racing employees.

Competitive Landscape
West Virginia’s commercial casinos compete directly with
casino properties in several neighboring states. Hollywood
Casino at Charles Town Races competes with three
Maryland casinos for patrons from the greater Washington
D.C.-Baltimore area, while Wheeling Island Hotel Casino
Racetrack and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort
both face competition from casinos and racinos in
Pittsburgh and eastern Ohio. Up to five land-based casinos
have also been authorized in neighboring Virginia, although
none for locations near the West Virginia border.

Within the state, West Virginia casinos compete with a
network of up to 9,000 limited-stakes electronic gaming
devices (VLTs) situated at retail establishments, such as
bars and taverns.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting
In March, a bill to expressly authorize wagering on esports
events took effect after Gov. Jim Justice (R) allowed it to
become law without his signature.

The bill added esports events to the state’s statutory
definition of a sporting event eligible for sports wagering,
ensuring that esports betting could be legally offered by
West Virginia sportsbooks. Certain sports betting operators
had already received permission to offer wagers on esports
events prior to the legal change, but such approvals were
subject to the discretion of the West Virginia Lottery’s
director.

West Virginia

Iowa and Pennsylvania also considered bills to expressly
authorize betting on esports events in 2022, but neither
state saw its legislation become law.

Expansion
In March, the West Virginia Senate again passed a bill to
authorize West Virginia’s racinos to establish a secondary

casino location within the same county as their primary
facility, subject to local voter approval.

Among other conditions, racinos would be required to
maintain the same gaming offerings and other amenities at
their primary casino gaming location.

The bill was not taken up in the West Virginia House before
lawmakers adjourned the 2022 legislative session.

WYOMING

Wyoming reported total sports betting revenue of $14.8

million in 2022, the first full year for the state’s mobile

sports wagering market.

Market Overview
Wyoming has no commercial casino venues but offers mobile sports betting
through four commercial sportsbook operators subject to regulation by the
Wyoming Gaming Commission. Sports betting is also available at tribal casinos.

KEY STATE INFORMATION

GROSS SPORTS BETTING REVENUE 2022
$14.8M

An April 2021 law authorized Wyoming’s gaming and racing regulator to issue
permits for online sports betting to operators that are already licensed in at
least three other states. Online sports betting began in September 2021.

SPORT BETTING TAX REVENUE 2022
$843K

Market Performance
In 2022, total online sports betting revenue in Wyoming was $14.8 million,
more than triple the prior year total of $4.0 million.

The significantly higher revenue figure reflected the fact it was the first full year
of legal mobile sports betting in the state, with 2021’s total reflective of fewer
than four months of operations. In addition, the number of active operators in
the Wyoming market doubled from two to four, following the launch of FanDuel
in the state in March 2022 and Caesars Sportsbook in August.

Gaming Tax Distribution
Revenue from online sports betting in Wyoming is taxed at a rate of 10 percent,
applied after deductions of free bets and other bonuses and promotions.
Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax

applied to wagering handle. Federal excise payments are
also deductible from revenue subject to the state’s sports
betting tax.

In 2022, online sports betting generated total state tax
revenue of approximately $843,000, versus around
$112,000 in 2021.

Under state law, the first $300,000 in sports wagering tax
revenue in each fiscal year is appropriated to the Wyoming
Department of Health and then redistributed to county
health programs for the prevention and treatment of
problem gambling. Remaining tax payments are deposited
into the state’s General Fund.

Competitive Landscape
Although sports betting is legal in several states that
border Wyoming, including South Dakota and Nebraska,
online sports betting is currently only available in southern
neighbor Colorado.

Wyoming’s online sports betting platforms face in-state
competition from sportsbooks that can be offered by the
state’s three tribal casinos. Two additional sports betting
platforms were also licensed by the Wyoming Gaming
Commission in 2022, but had yet to launch operations
before the end of the year.

In addition to sports betting and tribal gaming, Wyoming’s
broader gaming market includes pari-mutuel wagering on
horse races and electronic gaming devices in bars and
other establishments based on player skill.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Illegal Gaming
In December, the Wyoming Gaming Commission voted
to adopt formal regulations applicable to skill-based
electronic gaming devices in licensed bars and other
establishments.

The rules were developed by the commission pursuant
to a 2021 state law that permanently authorized up to
four such devices in eligible facilities, subject to certain
restrictions including a maximum bet limit of $3 and
maximum prize payout of $3,000. The Wyoming Gaming
Commission’s regulations established more specific rules
for the operation of so-called skill-based amusement
games, including game standards, audit requirements,
responsible gaming provisions and potential disciplinary
actions for regulatory violations.

The regulations were approved by commissioners following
a public consultation on a draft version of the rules that
was published in October.

Alongside Wyoming, the District of Columbia has also
established a regulatory regime for skill game devices that
purport to avoid state gambling prohibitions because their
outcomes depend, to varying degrees, on player skill. In
contrast, Virginia has enacted a series of bills, including
one measure in 2022, to expressly prohibit skill game
devices. Similar legislation was also considered in 2022 in
Kentucky, Missouri and Pennsylvania.
