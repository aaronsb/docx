A Message from the American Gaming Association

May 2023
Dear Gaming Industry Colleague:

| am pleased to present State of the States 2023: The AGA
Survey of the Commercial Casino Industry, the American
Gaming Association’s (AGA) signature research report

and the definitive economic analysis of U.S. commercial
gaming in 2022.

Without a doubt, 2022 was a remarkable year for the U.S.
commercial gaming sector and for the AGA. This is all
despite lingering challenges from the pandemic early in the
year and widespread questions about the overall health of
the economy in the latter half of the year.

Continued strong consumer demand for gaming
entertainment generated record-breaking commercial
gaming revenue of $60 billion in 2022, a 14 percent
increase from the previous year. When tribal gaming
revenue numbers are reported later this year, total

U.S. gaming revenue will likely exceed $100 billion, an
exceptional achievement amid the still ongoing recovery of
international visitation, business travel and conventions.

Our industry has a long history of adapting to changing
operating environments and consumer preferences. Over
the past three years that ability has enabled us to weather
the storm of 2020 and end 2022 as an industry about 30
percent bigger than we were in 2019, with a different mix
of consumers, markets and gaming verticals than just a
few years ago.

Last year, 84 million American adults visited a casino,
with the average age on the casino floor falling to about
42 years old, down from nearly 50 years old in 2019.
More than half of American adults live in jurisdictions

that feature access to legal, regulated sports betting, and
iGaming is significantly growing the overall revenue picture
in the states where it is legal.

As commercial gaming and online sports betting
expanded into new markets last year, we have continued
to engage lawmakers, regulators and the public, ensuring
these critical stakeholders appreciate our commitment

to sustainable relationships with consumers and

local communities. In addition to maintaining trusted
relationships with policymakers and serving as a reliable
resource for insight and industry perspectives, we also
drove industry collaboration to advance our common
interests. Last year, with the support of our members, we
continued to set a high bar for responsible marketing and
promotion, uniting the broader sports betting ecosystem
around responsible gaming via AGA's Have A Game Plan.®
Bet Responsibly.” campaign.

Here in Washington, the AGA advocated for industry
priorities, including sound tax policy, modernization of
anti-money laundering regulations, and other issues that
impact our members. In 2022, we worked with travel
partners to pass the Omnibus Travel and Tourism Act,
creating the first ever unified tourism strategy across the
federal government. We built bipartisan congressional
support to press the Department of Justice to crack on
down illegal gambling. We will continue to advance these
and other important issues—including the repeal of the
federal sports betting excise tax and an increase to the slot
tax reporting threshold—over the coming months.

Finally, G2E Las Vegas brought together nearly 25,000
members of the industry for the premier gaming event of
the year, where the global gaming community convenes

to do business, make connections and drive the future of
gaming. The show floor radiated with energy and reinforced
our industry’s strength.

After decades of relatively steady, low-key growth, our
industry is coming off two record years of gaming revenue
and we are part of the national conversation in a way that
we've never been before. It is an exciting time to be in
gaming, and the AGA remains focused on safeguarding
gaming’s standing in the political, business and social
spheres. | look forward to working with you all again this
year to maintain our leading position in the world of travel,
entertainment and gaming.

With detailed information on the U.S. gaming market
and financial performance data for every commercial
gaming state, State of the States 2023 provides the most
comprehensive economic guide to the commercial casino
industry. | would like to thank our partners at VIXIO
GamblingCompliance for their invaluable assistance in its
creation.

| hope you will find this a useful reference and, as always,
thank you for your continued partnership.

Sincerely,

William C. Miller, Jr.
President and CEO
American Gaming Association
