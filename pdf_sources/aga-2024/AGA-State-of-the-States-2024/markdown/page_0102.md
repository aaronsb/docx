Continued growth in iGaming revenue saw

Pennsylvania’s commercial casino gaming industry
report record revenue of $5.86 billion in 2023, an
increase of 9.8 percent on the prior year.

Market Overview

Pennsylvania offers commercial casino gaming at 11 land-based casinos and six
racinos, all of which are authorized to operate electronic gaming devices, table
games and sports betting. The properties are regulated by the Pennsylvania
Gaming Control Board (PGCB).

In 2004, the Pennsylvania legislature approved the Horse Development

and Gaming Act, which authorized electronic gaming devices at racetracks,
standalone casinos, and three smaller casino-resorts. Table games were
approved by the legislature in 2010. In 2017, a wide-ranging gaming expansion
bill authorized up to ten additional “satellite” or mini-casinos, each limited to a
maximum of 750 electronic gaming devices and 40 table games.

In addition, the 2017 legislation authorized Pennsylvania commercial casinos to
apply for separate licenses to offer land-based and online sports betting as well
as iGaming via affiliated online casino platforms. At the end of 2023, a total of
21 online casinos and 12 online sportsbooks were operational in Pennsylvania,
compared to 20 online casinos and 14 online sportsbooks a year prior.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record $5.86
billion, up 9.8 percent compared with the previous year.

Pennsylvania’s iGaming market was the primary driver of overall casino gaming
revenue growth in 2023. Total iGaming revenue for the year, as reported by the
Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, was $1.74 billion, up 27.6 percent relative

to 2022.
