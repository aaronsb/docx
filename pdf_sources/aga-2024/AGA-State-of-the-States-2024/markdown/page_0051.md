In addition, the rules would require multi-factor verification
to access wagering accounts and oblige operators to

verify that the owner of a sports betting account is also

an authorized user of the financial account being used to
deposit funds for sports wagering.

The rules, which were subject to a public comment

period and still pending final approval at the conclusion

of the year, were proposed in the wake of a high-profile
investigation into alleged illegal betting by student-athletes
at the University lowa and lowa State University.

Expansion

In July, the Cedar Rapids City Council voted to set aside
land for what would be lowa’s 20th commercial casino
property.

Voters in Linn County—which includes Cedar Rapids—
passed a referendum in November 2021 to grant local

approval for a potential casino in the city, but legislation
approved by the state legislature during the 2022 session
imposed a moratorium to prevent the lowa Racing and
Gaming Commission from issuing any additional casino
licenses until at least June 1, 2024.

The lowa Racing and Gaming Commission twice voted to
deny a new casino in Cedar Rapids in 2014 and 2017,
citing concerns of market saturation. Regulators had been
prepared to revisit the issue in the wake of the 2021 local
referendum, however.

Under a motion approved by the city council, a developer
has the option to acquire the site for a potential casino in
Cedar Rapids through the end of 2025, with a possible
one-year extension depending on the status of the state
casino licensing process.
