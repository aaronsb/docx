City area as authorized under New York's 2022-23 state

Policy & Regulatory Review
Responsible Gaming

New Jersey officials announced two new sets of formal
best practices in 2023 to govern responsible gaming
and advertising activities by licensed iGaming and sports
betting operators in the state.

In February, the state’s Attorney General and Division of
Gaming Enforcement jointly announced the introduction
of new standards for responsible gaming that oblige
internet casinos and sportsbook platforms to have systems
in place to monitor player activities and flag potential
signs of problem gambling. Each operator also must

have a specialist responsible gaming team to intervene

in providing resources and information to those at-risk
patrons flagged by the automated systems.

In April, similar standards for advertising were announced,
with operators obliged to offer clear terms and conditions
for any bonuses or other promotions and give players the
opportunity to opt-out of direct marketing.

The new standards are not a formal regulatory requirement
and were developed instead as best practices to

give regulators more leeway to adjust them upon
implementation by the industry.

Internet Gaming

In June, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) signed a bill to extend
statutory authorization for iGaming in New Jersey for a
further five years until at least 2028.

A so-called sunset provision in New Jersey’s 2013 iGaming
legislation meant the law would have expired exactly 10
years after the market’s launch without further action by
lawmakers to renew it.

As initially introduced, the bill signed by Gov. Murphy
would have extended authorization for iGaming for a
further 10 years. The bill was abruptly amended in
the New Jersey Assembly to limit authorization to just
two years, before lawmakers then agreed to a five-year
extension lasting through November 2028.
