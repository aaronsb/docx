Market Overview

Kentucky has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting via state-
licensed racetrack operators and affiliated online sportsbook platforms.

A state law passed in 2023 authorized retail sports betting at racetracks
and simulcast facilities that also offer parimutuel wagering on horse races.
Licensed racetrack operators may also partner with up to three mobile sports
betting platforms—or “skins”—to offer mobile sports betting to players
across Kentucky. Sports wagering is regulated by the Kentucky Horse Racing
Commission.

Retail and mobile sports betting was launched in September 2023. At the end
of the year, sports wagering was available at a total of seven retail locations and
via seven mobile sportsbook platforms.

state pension liabilities. A total of 2.5 percent of sports betting tax revenue
is also distributed to a fund for services providing problem gambling support,
education and treatment.
