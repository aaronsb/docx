Following a series of workshops with industry executives,
the Nevada Gaming Control Board launched a new
initiative in November to enable certain modifications to
gaming technologies and systems to be deployed without
requiring inspection or prior approval by either the board
or an independent testing laboratory. Industry officials
had previously complained that Nevada’s approval process
meant new gaming technologies could often be deployed
quicker in other markets.

In June, Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) separately signed a bill to
make several reforms to Nevada gaming statutes. Among
other things, the new legislation means Nevada casino
gaming operators no longer have to file an annual report
with the Nevada Gaming Control Board related to their
gaming operations outside the state.

Sports Betting

In October, the Nevada Gaming Commission voted to adopt
regulatory amendments to facilitate betting on esports
contests through the state’s licensed sportsbooks.

The new regulations enable sports betting operators to
generally offer wagers on esports contests just as they do
on traditional sporting events, provided they have been
able to obtain sufficient information regarding the integrity
of the esports event in question. Operators are also
required to submit a quarterly report on the esports events
on which they accept wagers.

Under previous regulations, Nevada sportsbook operators
were required to obtain prior regulatory approval for each
and every esports tournament they wished to offer bets on.

The updated regulations were developed by a special
advisory panel formed in 2021 at the behest of the state
legislature.
