market faced a full twelve months of competition from
mobile sportsbooks in neighboring Louisiana.

In 2023, casino-resorts in Mississippi’s Gulf Coast

region were more resilient than those located along the
Mississippi River. Gulf Coast casinos located in Biloxi and
other markets reported combined annual casino gaming
revenue of $1.59 billion, down just 0.6 percent from the
prior year. In contrast, riverboat casinos located in the
central region of the Mississippi River reported gaming
revenue of $327.2 million, down 3.0 percent, while gaming
revenue generated by casinos in the northern region of the
state declined 11.1 percent to $565.6 million.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Mississippi imposes a graduated tax based on monthly
gaming revenue. Casinos pay a 4 percent tax on gross
gaming revenue below $50,000 per month; 6 percent on
revenue between $50,000 and $134,000 per month; and
8 percent on gaming revenue exceeding $134,000.

In addition, each of the local Mississippi municipalities

that host commercial casinos charge an additional annual
license fee at an average rate of 3-4 percent of gaming
revenue. Revenue from sports wagering is taxed at the same
state and local rates as revenue from traditional casino
games. Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Mississippi commercial casinos generated
approximately $294.3 million in direct gaming tax
revenue, down 2.9 percent against the previous year,
according to statistics collected by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission.

Of that total amount, approximately $158.8 million was
distributed to Mississippi’s General Fund from which it is
appropriated annually to support various state budgetary
needs, including education programs, transportation, local
public safety programs and social welfare initiatives.

An additional $99.5 million worth of gaming tax revenue
was transferred to local governments that host casinos. A
further $36 million was allocated for Mississippi’'s Special
Bond Sinking Fund, which is mainly used to pay for
improvements to state roads and bridges.

Competitive Landscape

Mississippi’s commercial casinos compete in a crowded
statewide gaming market that also includes three tribal
casino-resorts owned by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw
Indians. Unlike the 26 commercial properties along the
Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River, the three tribal
casinos are located in the center of the state near Jackson,
the state’s largest city.

Commercial casino operators also face significant
competition from properties in neighboring states.
Mississippi casinos in the Tunica/Lula market compete
directly with Arkansas’ Southland Casino Racing racino for
patrons from the Memphis area. Meanwhile, Mississippi
Gulf Coast casinos compete with various casinos in
Louisiana.

While Mississippi’s legal sports betting market remains
limited to sportsbook operations located within commercial
and tribal casino-resorts, statewide mobile sports betting
is available in the bordering states of Louisiana, Tennessee
and Arkansas.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In March, Gov. Tate Reeves (R) signed a bill to establish a
legislative task force to study the potential authorization
of mobile sports betting in Mississippi. The study bill was
passed with little opposition in the state legislature, even
though a series of past bills to regulate mobile sports
betting had failed to advance out of committee since 2019.

Mississippi’s two gaming markets showcased contrasting
results in 2023 with Gulf Coast casinos maintaining
near-record gaming revenue for the third consecutive
year. Conversely, revenue from riverboats moored on the
Mississippi River declined again, constituting only 36.0
percent of the state’s total gaming revenue lowest — the
market’s lowest ever share.
