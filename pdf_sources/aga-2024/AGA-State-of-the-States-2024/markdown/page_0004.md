as they do to most other businesses. They also do not
include the federal excise tax of 0.25 percent generally
applied to sports betting handle across most states, nor
the $50 fee per sportsbook employee that businesses
that pay the excise tax must also pay. For the purposes

of calculating state gaming tax revenue totals, reported
tax figures include taxes directed to state and local
governments and the specific casino gaming revenue funds
established by those entities. They also include mandatory
allocations of gaming revenue from commercial gaming
operations to non-government entities, such as problem
gambling services, race purses, breeding programs, and
other funds used to support local racing industries.

In certain states, gaming is operated under the authority
of the state government, and a portion of casino revenue
is then redistributed to private operators. Where this is the
case, this report considers the effective tax rate applied

to gaming operators to be the portion of gaming revenue
retained by the state or its designated beneficiaries.

This report uses the term “electronic gaming device” to
refer to the various types of gaming devices installed in
casinos, commonly known as “slot machines.” Although
the general public may not differentiate between the
various types of electronic gaming devices, there are
often important regulatory and technological distinctions
between them and specific legal definitions are applied to
different categories of devices in different states. State-
specific terminology for electronic gaming devices includes
video lottery terminals (VLTs), video gaming terminals
(VGTs), video poker and electronic gaming machines,
among others.

Information on supplier licensing in the table in this report
is limited to those supplier entities that either manufacture
electronic gaming devices or table game equipment or
distribute or otherwise sell them to casinos. In many states,
additional licensing requirements are applicable to the
suppliers of various other goods and services to casinos.
Readers are advised to consult the websites of state gaming
regulatory agencies for more specific information.
