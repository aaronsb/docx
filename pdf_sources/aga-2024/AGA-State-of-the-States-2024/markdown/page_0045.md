authorized to operate in bars, restaurants, truck stops and

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

The authorization of additional land-based casino
properties was a core area of focus for lllinois gaming
regulators in 2023.

In June, the lllinois Gaming Board found Bally’s
Corporation suitable to operate a casino in the City of
Chicago. Three months later, the board awarded Bally’s
Chicago a temporary operating permit to allow for the
opening of the first casino facility in lllinois’ largest city.

The gaming board also acted to extend operating permits
for temporary casinos in Rockford and Waukegan, which

like the Chicago casino were both also authorized under

[llinois’ 2019 gaming expansion law.

That law allowed for casino developers licensed under
the 2019 act to operate temporary facilities for an initial

period of two years, with the possibility of a twelve-month
extension subject to approval by the lllinois Gaming Board.
In November, however, Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signed a

bill that now requires the lllinois Gaming Board to extend
authorizations for temporary casinos for up to 30 months
following the initial two-year period, enabling temporary
casino facilities to operate for up to four and a half years
while permanent casinos are under construction.

Regulatory Reform

In August, Gov. Pritzker signed legislation to allow for
individuals with felony convictions to obtain employment
in non-gaming positions in Illinois’ commercial casino
industry for the first time.

Under prior state law, any individual with a criminal
conviction was automatically barred from working in

a casino. The new legislation repealed that restriction

as it applies to non-gaming roles, such as working in
restaurants or other amenities within a casino. The lllinois
Gaming Board was instead granted discretion to determine
whether an individual should be suitable for a license to
work in a non-gaming position based on their particular
circumstances, such as the nature and severity of the
conviction and the length of time since that conviction
occurred.

Illegal Gaming

[llinois was one of several states that looked to address the
operation of unregulated electronic gaming devices outside
of casinos or other licensed gaming venues in 2023.

In March, a bill was approved by the lllinois Senate to
extend the definition of a “gambling device” under state
law to cover devices purporting to offer sweepstakes-
based games. The stated intention of the legislation was
to prevent electronic gaming devices being able to operate
under the pretense of a non-gambling activity.

The bill was not taken up by the Illinois House prior to
the end of the state’'s 2023 legislative session in May;
however, the bill carried over to 2024 and remained
pending as of the end of the year.
