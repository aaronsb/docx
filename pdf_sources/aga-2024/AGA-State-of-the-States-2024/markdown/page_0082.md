$481.3 million, up 7.7 percent from 2022. Unlike in other
states with both land-based and mobile sports betting,
revenue in Nevada was equally split between the two
channels in 2023, reflecting Nevada’s status as a major
tourist destination for out-of-state visitors and regulatory
restrictions that continue to require in-person registration
of mobile wagering accounts.

Continuing a post-pandemic trend, overall growth of the
Nevada commercial casino gaming market was again led
by the Las Vegas Strip in 2023. Commercial casino-resorts
on the Strip reported total revenue from electronic gaming
devices and table games of $8.69 billion, up 7.2 percent
versus 2022, while those in other parts of Nevada that are
typically more dependent on local players than out-of-state
tourists reported total casino gaming revenue of $6.35
billion, up slightly less than one percent.

In 2023, Las Vegas received some 40.8 million visits from
tourists, up 5.2 percent from 2022, according to the Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Nevada commercial casinos are subject to a state tax

of 6.75 percent on all gross gaming revenue exceeding
$134,000 per month, with lower rates applying to revenue
below that threshold.

Casino operators are also subject to a tax on live
entertainment offerings hosted within their resorts.
Quarterly and annual fees are also assessed according to
the number of electronic gaming devices and table games
installed on casinos’ gaming floors. Meanwhile, host
counties and municipalities may impose additional fees.

Nevada sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Nevada collected a total of $1.21 billion in
state gaming and live entertainment tax revenue from
commercial casinos, an increase of 5.0 percent versus
the prior year.

In accordance with state law, the vast majority of tax
revenue from gaming is directed to Nevada's General Fund,
then redistributed on a biennial basis at the direction of
the legislature, for purposes including statewide education
programs, transportation services and general budgetary
needs. Additional gaming tax funds go to local school
systems and county governments.

Competitive Landscape

As one of the world’s foremost destinations for
entertainment and business conventions, Las Vegas faces
a somewhat different competitive environment than most
other U.S. gaming markets.

While Las Vegas’' commercial casinos compete for drive-

in patrons to some extent with southern California tribal
casinos, the city as a whole also competes with various
national and international locations for discretionary tourist
and business traveler dollars.

In December 2023, two major new Las Vegas casino-
resorts—Fontainebleau Las Vegas and Durango Resort—
opened their doors. The landmark Tropicana Las Vegas
casino-resort is set to be shuttered in 2024, however, in
order to make way for a new baseball stadium adjacent to
the Las Vegas Strip.

Outside of Las Vegas, commercial casinos in Reno and
other parts of northern Nevada face fierce regional
competition from several dozen tribal casino-resorts in
northern California.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Illegal Gaming

In April, the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board
sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland

on behalf of gaming regulatory agencies in Nevada and

six other states, urging the U.S. Department of Justice

to prioritize enforcement actions against illegal offshore
sports betting and iGaming platforms.

“The many significant threats posed by offshore illegal
gambling cannot be addressed by states alone and,
therefore, require heightened federal attention and
engagement,” said the letter, which was co-signed by
chief gaming regulatory officials in New Jersey, Michigan,
[llinois, Colorado, Louisiana and Mississippi.

The U.S. Department of Justice sent a response to the
letter in July, insisting that federal law enforcement
agencies take illegal gambling seriously and continue to
investigate illegal iGaming operations.

Regulatory Reform

Nevada policymakers advanced several gaming regulatory
reform initiatives in 2023.
