and then redistributed to various state programs including
education, infrastructural investments, policing and
emergency services in accordance with the state’s annual
budget approved by lawmakers.

Competitive Landscape

Connecticut’s wider gaming market is dominated by the
Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods tribal casino-resorts operated
by the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot sovereign tribal
nations on their reservation lands. The two tribal casino-
resorts, both among the largest in the United States,
opened in the mid-1990s and were expanded in 2021 to
include retail sportsbook operations in accordance with
amendments to the two tribes’ gaming compacts.

While Connecticut remains the only state in New England
with iGaming, retail and mobile sports betting is available
in all three bordering states. Commercial casinos in Rhode
Island, Massachusetts and New York also compete directly
for patrons with Connecticut’s two tribal casino-resorts.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In June, Gov. Ned Lamont (D) signed a bill prohibiting
Connecticut colleges and universities from receiving money
in return for marketing sports betting or iGaming directly to
their student bodies.

The legislation was introduced in response to lawmakers’
concerns over media coverage of the terms of a sports
betting-related marketing agreement in Colorado. Similar
bills were approved in 2023 in Louisiana and Maryland.

The American Gaming Association also updated its
Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering in

2023 to specifically prohibit any partnerships that involve
promotions by colleges, aside from those to alumni
networks or for responsible gaming purposes. The code
already prevented AGA members from advertising on
college campuses or via college-owned media.

Regulatory Reform

Gov. Lamont (D) signed a separate bill in June to make
several amendments to Connecticut’s 2021 law on sports
wagering and iGaming.

The new legislation requires certain employees at live
casino studios that stream blackjack, roulette and other
popular table games to iGaming players to be formally
licensed by the Connecticut Department of Consumer
Protection. The bill also amended the definition of a key
employee subject to licensure under the original law to
also include chief information or data security officers.
Finally, the legislation made a technical change to the
definition of a “sporting event” eligible for sports wagering
in Connecticut.

2023 vs 2022

Despite reporting strong growth in sports betting revenue

in 2023, Connecticut lost its status as the largest legal
sports wagering market in the New England region following
the launch of sportshook operations in neighboring
Massachusetts in the early part of the year.
