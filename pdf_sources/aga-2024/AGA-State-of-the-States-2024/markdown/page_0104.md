regulating the devices have advocated for legislation that
would allow them to avoid oversight by the Pennsylvania
Gaming Control Board and pay significantly lower taxes
and fees than those applied to the commercial casino
gaming industry.

The ongoing debate over the future of unregulated gaming
devices in Pennsylvania further evolved in November when
the state’s Commonwealth Court ruled that at least one
prominent device did not meet the statutory definition of
a “slot machine,” and therefore was not necessarily illegal
under current law.

Expansion

In January, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board
awarded the state’s fifth Category 4 casino license for
a satellite casino project sited near Pennsylvania State
University in Centre County.

In 2020, a minority owner of Rivers Casino Pittsburgh won
an auction to acquire the license before later establishing a
partnership with Bally’s Corporation to develop and operate
the casino that will offer the maximum permitted 750
electronic gaming devices plus 30 table games and a retail
sportsbook.

As of the end of 2023, however, the proposed satellite
casino remained subject to a pending legal challenge that
was filed before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court by a rival
casino operator. The court challenge argues that having a
minority ownership in one casino is insufficient to qualify
for a Category 4 license per the state’s 2017 gaming
expansion law.

U.S. in 2023. However, revenue reported by casinos in the
largest of those three markets—Philadelphia—was down
slightly from the previous year.
