In 2023, Nebraska’s racinos generated approximately
$17.8 million in gaming tax revenue, compared with $2.8
million the prior year.

Under Nebraska's constitution, 70 percent of casino
gaming tax revenue is allocated to the state’s Property Tax
Credit Cash Fund. A further 25 percent of tax revenue is
distributed to the host county, city and village governments
of each racino, with the remaining 5 percent split evenly
between a compulsive gambling assistance fund and
Nebraska’s General Fund.

Competitive Landscape

After launching in September 2022, Nebraska’s
commercial casino gaming market remains very much in
its infancy with all four racino and sportsbook locations
still operating as temporary facilities as of the end of
2023. Permanent casino-resorts featuring a wider array

of gaming and entertainment offerings are expected to
open at all four racino locations in either 2024 or early
2025. In addition, established racetracks in Hastings and
South Sioux City are also eligible to obtain licenses to offer
casino gaming.

The forthcoming racinos in Omaha and South Sioux City
will compete directly with several commercial casinos in
Council Bluffs and Sioux City, lowa. There are also four

established tribal casinos on Indian reservation lands in

Nebraska.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Regulatory Reform

In April, Gov. Jim Pillen (R) signed a bill to make a series
of technical corrections to Nebraska's 2021 casino
legislation and the state’s lottery laws.

Among other things, the new law amended the definition of
a “licensed racetrack enclosure” where casino gaming may
be conducted to explicitly include all areas of a racetrack
facility, including the grandstand, parking lot or any other
area designated by the Nebraska Racing and Gaming
Commission.

The legislation also clarified the commission’s authority
to recommend future statutory reforms and impose
administrative fines in the event of non-compliance with
the state’s gaming law.

Sports Betting

In June, Nebraska became the 36th state with legal sports
betting when a sportshook was opened at the WarHorse
Gaming temporary racino facility in Lincoln.

Although 2020'’s state constitutional amendment on
commercial casino gaming did not explicitly reference the
possibility of sports betting, state lawmakers considered
the language to be sufficiently broad and decided to
include sports wagering in the enabling legislation

to implement the amendment that was approved the
following year.

After initially prioritizing the rollout of electronic gaming
devices and other casino games at temporary racino
locations, the Nebraska Racing and Gaming Commission
adopted regulations for sports betting in late 2022. A
catalog of approved sports wagering events was approved
by the commission in May 2023.

Following the launch of sports betting at its Lincoln facility,
WarHorse Gaming also opened a temporary sportsbook in
November at the site of its forthcoming racino in Omaha.
