Commercial casino gaming revenue in Michigan hit a

MICHIGAN

record high of $3.58 billion in 2023, as strong growth
in iGaming offset a decline in traditional casino gaming

revenue at Detroit’s three land-based casinos.

Market Overview

Michigan offers commercial casino gaming at three land-based casinos, each
of which operates electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting.
The casinos are regulated by the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB).

Commercial casinos were first authorized in 1996, when Michigan voters
approved a referendum permitting a maximum of three casinos in Detroit.

In December 2019, lawmakers authorized the state’'s commercial casinos

and 12 recognized Indian tribes to offer statewide online sports betting and
iGaming through a single sportsbook, casino and poker platform affiliated with
each casino or tribe. Online gaming commenced in January 2021. At the end
of 2023, a total of 14 online sportsbooks—one less than the previous year—,
15 internet casinos and three online poker platforms were operational.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $3.58 billion,
up 9.9 percent versus the previous year.

The record total reflected continued growth in Michigan’s iGaming market,
which offset a decline in traditional casino gaming revenue at casino properties
in Detroit.

Total iGaming revenue from online casino games and poker reached $1.92
billion, up 21.6 percent from 2022. In contrast, combined revenue from
electronic gaming devices and table games at commercial land-based casinos
was $1.22 billion, down 2.7 percent. Notably, land-based casino gaming
