Pennsylvania’s commercial casinos reported land-based
casino gaming revenue of $3.44 billion, a more modest
increase of 1.6 percent compared to the prior year.
Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices increased
by 3.1 percent to $2.46 billion, offsetting a 1.9 percent
decline in annual table game revenue to $971.7 million.

Total statewide sports betting revenue was $686.9 million,
up 15.0 percent. Online sports betting revenue grew by
approximately 17.4 percent and accounted for $643.0
million of the statewide sports wagering total. In contrast,
revenue from Pennsylvania’s land-based sportsbooks fell
for the second straight year, dropping 11.8 percent to
$43.9 million.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Pennsylvania land-based commercial casinos and racinos
pay a b5 percent tax rate on electronic gaming device
revenue, a 16 percent tax rate on table game revenue, and
a b0 percent effective tax rate on revenue from electronic
versions of table games.

Revenue from iGaming is taxed at a headline rate of either
54 or 16 percent, depending on whether the online casino
game in question simulates an electronic gaming device or
a table game.

Sports betting revenue is subject to a 36 percent
effective tax rate, which includes a two percent tax for
local municipalities and is applied after deduction of
promotional free bets offered to players. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, total casino gaming tax revenue in Pennsylvania
amounted to $2.32 billion, some $250 million more than
was generated in any other state in the nation. The tax
revenue total was up 10.6 percent from 2022.

The state’s share of gaming tax revenue in Pennsylvania is
primarily used to reduce school taxes paid by Pennsylvania
property owners, with additional allocations for local law
enforcement grants and responsible gaming programs. In
2023, the state’s share of direct gaming tax revenue was
approximately $1.62 billion.

Approximately $196.2 million was distributed to
Pennsylvania’s horse racing industry in 2023, while
remaining monies were allocated to an economic
development and tourism fund, to county governments,
and to the municipalities that host casinos and racinos.

Competitive Landscape

Pennsylvania’s casinos operate at the intersection of the
fiercely competitive Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.
Individual Pennsylvania casinos compete against rival
properties in Delaware and northern Maryland to the
south; New York City and Atlantic City to the east; Ohio to
the west; and West Virginia to the southwest.

Competition within the state’s borders has also intensified
since 2017’s gaming expansion law, following the opening
of four additional satellite casinos in different regions of
Pennsylvania that must be owned or operated by one of
the state’s incumbent land-based casinos. The 2017 law
generally restricted the site of the state’s satellite casinos
to at least 25 miles from a pre-existing casino property,
among other conditions.

Pennsylvania commercial casinos also face a degree of
competition from the operation of lawful electronic gaming
devices (VGTs) at truck stops. As authorized under the
state’s 2017 gaming expansion law, truck stops meeting a
certain set of criteria are eligible to install up to five VGTs
on their premises. In 2023, electronic gaming devices
operational at a total of 71 truck stops across the state
generated approximately $41.2 million in gaming revenue,
down 2.0 percent from the previous year.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Illegal Gaming

Pennsylvania’s network of tens of thousands of unregulated
electronic gaming devices operating in bars and
convenience stores across the state was a focus of state
policymakers, law enforcement and court judges in 2023.

In October, the state Senate committee with primary
responsibility for gaming matters heard conflicting
testimony as to how to best address the devices which
purport to offer games based on skill but resemble those
typically found in a casino. Providers of the devices
advocated for their operations to be recognized as lawful
and regulated in Pennsylvania. Representatives of the
state’s commercial casino industry instead called for the
devices to be more clearly prohibited and eliminated, while
a third proposed approach would see the state expand its
VGT market to include bars and other locations beyond
truck stops, similar to Illinois.

Contrasting bills to either prohibit or regulate so-called
Pennsylvania Skill devices were introduced in the Senate
in 2023, but neither had advanced out of committee
before the end of the year. Notably, proponents of
