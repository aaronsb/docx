approved in 2022 which will allow the Jake's 58 casino
facility on Long Island to double the size of its gaming floor
up to a maximum of 2,000 electronic gaming devices.
Local government approvals for the expanded casino were
granted in 2023.

Established casino gaming facilities in downstate New York
have traditionally competed to varying extents with tribal
casino-resorts in Connecticut and with commercial casinos
in eastern Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Casinos and racinos in parts of upstate New York also
directly compete with the state’s 21 tribal casinos operated
by three federally recognized sovereign tribal nations.

In terms of sports betting, New York’s mobile sportsbook
platforms compete to a limited extent with those available
in neighboring New Jersey that are also able to offer
iGaming plus a wider range of bonuses and promotions
due to the significantly lower tax rate applied to sports
wagering revenue in New Jersey. After legislation was
approved in Vermont in 2023, each of New York'’s
bordering states, as well as Ontario across the Canadian
border, either currently offers legal mobile sports betting or
is set to do so in the near future.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

In January, an independent Gaming Facility Location Board
issued a request for applications to kick off a process to
award up to three licenses for new commercial casinos in
the downstate New York region.

The board also adopted rules to require a minimum upfront
fee of $500 million for each of the three licenses, with the
same amount required as a minimum capital investment in
each project.

The location board’s action triggered a consultation phase
during which prospective applicants were able to submit

a series of formal questions regarding the terms of the
selection process. At the end of the year, the board was
still in the process of responding to a second set of follow-
up questions submitted by potential operators. Formal
applications are due to be submitted within 30 days after
the board issues those responses.

Among other criteria, casino license applications will be
evaluated based on their proposed capital investment,
proposed tax rates, projected revenue and job generation,
range of proposed amenities, impact on surrounding
communities, and workforce diversity plans.

Resorts World New York City in Queens regained its status as the most lucrative commercial casino property outside of
Nevada in 2023. The casino reported total annual revenue of more than $942 million, earned exclusively through electronic

gaming devices.
