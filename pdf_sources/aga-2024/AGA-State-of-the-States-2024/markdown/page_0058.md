Combined revenue from electronic gaming devices and
table games at Louisiana casinos and racinos was $2.33
billion, down 2.0 percent compared to 2022.

In contrast, total statewide sports betting revenue reached
$367.0 million, an increase of 70.1 percent from the prior
year. Mobile sports wagering accounted for 90.2 percent
of the sports betting total.

Growth in the Louisiana casino gaming market was not
spread evenly across all areas of the state. Whereas total
electronic gaming device and table game revenue increased
in the Lake Charles region—the state’s largest gaming
market—casino revenue was down year-over-year in the New
Orleans, Shreveport/Bossier and Baton Rouge markets.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Revenue from each type of commercial casino
establishment in Louisiana—riverboat casinos, racinos
and the New Orleans land-based casino—is subject to a
different tax structure.

Riverboat casinos pay a maximum effective tax rate of
27.5 percent, comprising a state gaming tax of 21.5
percent of revenue plus additional local taxes which vary
according to location.

Racino revenue is taxed at an effective rate of about 36
percent. That rate comprises an 18 percent contribution
to the Louisiana horse racing industry taken off the top,
with the remaining revenue subject to a state tax of 18.5
percent and local taxes of 4 percent.

The New Orleans land-based casino pays the greater of
either a 21.5 percent tax on gaming revenue or an annual
fee of $60 million. The land-based casino must also remit
rent and various other payments to local authorities, as
established under its operating contract.

Meanwhile, sports betting revenue is taxed at a rate of 10
percent in the case of land-based sports wagering and 15
percent for online sports betting. Sportsbook operations
are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Louisiana’s commercial casino, racino and sports
betting operations generated total gaming tax revenue of
approximately $603.3 million, up 0.3 percent from the
previous year.

In accordance with state law, the majority of gaming tax
revenue is remitted to Louisiana’s General Fund. From
there, monies are appropriated at the direction of the
legislature and used to pay for public education, public
retirement systems, highway construction, and fire and
police protection, among other things. Legislation approved
in 2023 also allocates a minimum of either $500,000 or
3 percent of total annual tax revenue from sports betting
to a state problem gambling fund.

In addition, the state’s horse racing industry received
approximately $57.1 million in 2023 from taxes on
racinos’ revenue from electronic gaming devices.

Competitive Landscape

Louisiana’s commercial casinos and racinos compete with
five tribal casinos scattered throughout the state which
offer a full range of casino gaming, including sports betting.
There are also nearly 11,900 electronic gaming devices
offered in Louisiana at some 1,392 non-casino locations,
such as bars, restaurants, truck stops and off-track betting
parlors. In 2023, total statewide revenue from electronic
gaming devices in non-casino locations was $762.0 million,
down 5.9 percent from the previous year.

The competitive landscape for casino gaming in Louisiana
continues to evolve as the state’s riverboat casinos
gradually develop larger, land-based properties on
neighboring sites in accordance with a 2018 state law.

As of the end of 2023, two of Louisiana’s original riverboat
casinos had reopened as land-based casino-resorts while
