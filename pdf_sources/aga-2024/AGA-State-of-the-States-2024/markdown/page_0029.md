Gaming Tax Distribution

In accordance with a 2018 state constitutional
amendment, Arkansas commercial casinos are subject to
a graduated tax on their revenue. Casino revenue up to
$150 million is taxed at a rate of 13 percent, while a 20
percent rate is applied to any revenue above that amount.
Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Arkansas casinos and racinos generated
approximately $104.6 million in direct gaming tax revenue,
up 18.0 percent against the prior year.

Under Arkansas’ constitution, 55 percent of casino gaming
tax revenue is allocated to the state’s General Revenue
Fund, from which monies are appropriated each year for
education, public safety and various other purposes. A
further 27.5 percent of tax revenue is distributed to the
cities and counties that host casinos, with the remainder
used to supplement race purses at the state’s two
racetracks.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to competition among the state’s established
casinos and racinos, Arkansas gaming operators also
compete with various casino properties in neighboring
jurisdictions.

Southland Casino Racing in West Memphis competes
directly with several casinos in Tunica, Mississippi for
patrons from the Memphis metropolitan area, while
several large-scale tribal casino-resorts located just across
Arkansas’ western border in Oklahoma provide competition
to Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort as well as the pending
casino in Pope County.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

At the conclusion of 2023, Arkansas regulators faced
the prospect of going back to the drawing board in their
longstanding efforts to award the state’s fourth casino
license for a facility in Pope County.

In an October ruling, the state Supreme Court invalidated
the license awarded by the Arkansas Racing Commission
in 2021 to a commercial subsidiary of Oklahoma’s
Cherokee Nation after upholding a lower court ruling that
the commission overstepped its legal authority in doing so.
The Supreme Court previously voided a license that was
awarded to a rival bidder.

Following the latest decision, the Arkansas Racing
Commission said it was reviewing how to proceed with a
new process to award the final commercial casino license
available under a 2018 state constitutional amendment.

Regulatory Reform

In March, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) signed a
bill to amend Arkansas’ casino law to require licensure of
companies supplying electronic gaming devices or other
services to casinos.

Among other things, the new legislation requires all
gaming suppliers and their key employees to undergo

a criminal background check and demonstrate to the
Arkansas Racing Commission that they have the necessary
capabilities and qualifications to provide their equipment
or services to a gaming operator. Many of the changes in
the bill were more technical corrections than substantive
changes and aligned supplier licensing requirements

that were already established through administrative
regulations.

ARKANSAS: COMMERCIAL GAMING REVENUE (US$M)
2008 to 2023

Although the launch of mobile sportshooks has made
sports betting the fastest growing segment of Arkansas’
commercial casino gaming market, electronic gaming
devices continued to account for the vast majority—
approximately 85 percent—of total revenue in 2023.
