Gaming Tax Distribution

Missouri commercial casino gaming revenue is taxed at 21
percent. Additionally, there is a $2 admission fee for every
two hours that each patron is on board a riverboat.

In 2023, Missouri’s commercial casinos generated
total gaming tax revenue of $461.3 million, including
admissions fees, up 0.7 percent versus the previous year.

The majority of gaming tax revenue, approximately

$363 million in 2023, is reserved for Missouri’s Gaming
Proceeds For Education Fund. The fund was created by the
Missouri legislature in 1993 and distributes funds annually
to statewide education programs.

Approximately $69.2 million in gaming taxes and
admissions fees was paid in 2023 to local governments
that host Missouri’s casinos. A further $28.9 million
was set aside for additional programs, including veterans
initiatives, college assistance programs and problem
gambling support services, that are supported by a state
gaming fund.

Competitive Landscape

Missouri’'s commercial casinos face significant and
expanding out-of-state competition. The state’s trio of
casinos in the Kansas City area compete directly with

a fourth casino in Kansas City, Kansas, which since
2022 has been able to offer sports betting in addition to
electronic gaming devices and table games.

Elsewhere, Missouri casinos in the St. Louis market
compete with two casinos in East St. Louis and Alton,
[llinois. Additional competition is also pending as a result
of a casino expansion bill passed in lllinois in 2019 that
authorized electronic gaming devices and table games

at the FanDuel Sportsbook & Horse Racing facility at
Fairmount Park racetrack, some 11 miles from St. Louis.
In August 2023, the new Walker’s Bluff Casino Resort
was also opened in Williamson County, lllinois, roughly 60
miles from Missouri’s Century Casino Cape Girardeau.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

Proponents of legal sports betting in Missouri faced
another year of frustration in 2023, as legislation once
again stalled in the state Senate despite clearing the
Missouri House of Representatives by an overwhelming
majority for the second consecutive year.

In March, the House passed a bill to authorize both land-
based and mobile sports wagering, but the bill was never
brought up on the floor of the Senate. Senate opposition

stemmed from a desire by some for sports betting
legislation to also include provisions to regulate electronic
gaming devices at bars and other non-casino venues.

With that issue impeding sports betting legislation,
proponents started to lay the groundwork in late 2023 for
an alternative approach that would see sports wagering
approved directly by voters through a ballot initiative.

In September, a coalition of Missouri professional sports
teams submitted a series of potential ballot questions

to the Missouri Secretary of State. The coalition was
expected to commence signature gathering efforts in early
2024, with the aim of collecting the 170,000 required
voter signatures in order to qualify a referendum on sports
betting for the November 2024 ballot.

Regulatory Reform

The Missouri Gaming Commission approved a series
of new rules in 2023 to update the state’s regulations
applicable to commercial casino gaming.

In June, the commission filed 17 new regulations to update
or streamline existing rules applicable to the certification
and monitoring of electronic gaming devices, among other
things. A further five regulations were filed in August, with
the updated rules approved in October and December.
