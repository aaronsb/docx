In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $507.0 million, up 3.1 percent from the

DELAWARE

prior year, as growth in revenue from electronic gaming
devices and iGaming offset declining revenue from

table games and sports wagering.

Delaware offers commercial casino gaming at three racinos, each of which
operates electronic gaming devices, table games, sports betting and iGaming
under the authority of the Delaware Lottery.

In 1994, the Delaware legislature approved the Horseracing Redevelopment Act
which authorized racetracks to install electronic gaming devices. Table games
and limited sports betting (parlay wagers on professional football games) were
approved by the legislature in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Internet gaming
was approved in 2012.

After the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturned federal prohibitions on
expanded sports wagering, Delaware racinos in June 2018 expanded their
sports betting operations to include a full range of single-game and proposition
wagers on all sports, not just football. The state’s first mobile sports betting
platform was launched in December 2023, following the selection of a new
iGaming and sports betting partner by the Delaware Lottery.

Alongside full sportsbook operations at racinos and the lottery’s mobile
platform, the Delaware Lottery also offers football parlay cards at certain retail
outlets, including liquor and grocery stores.

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $507.0
million, up 3.1 percent versus the prior year and reflecting revenue growth from
both traditional and interactive casino games.
