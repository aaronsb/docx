Market Performance

In 2023, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue
reached a record total of $4.72 billion, up 11.6 percent
from the previous year.

The overall market growth was driven primarily by New
York’s mobile sports betting market, which remained by far
the largest in the country in 2023.

Total revenue from sports betting was $1.70 billion, up
24.2 percent from 2022, with mobile sports wagering
accounting for 99.6 percent of the total. Land-based
sportsbooks at New York’s four commercial casino-resorts
reported $7.4 million in revenue in 2023, down around 7.2
percent from the previous year.

Combined revenue from traditional casino games at New
York’s commercial casinos and racinos totaled $3.02
billion in 2023, up 5.6 percent against 2022. Revenue
from electronic gaming devices amounted to $2.82 billion.
That was an increase of 6.2 percent versus the previous
year and included some $75 million in annual revenue
generated by the Resorts World Hudson Valley casino,
which opened in December 2022. In contrast, statewide
revenue from table games was $199.8 million in 2023,
down 2.0 percent from the prior year.

In 2023, the Resorts World New York City racino

in Queens regained its status as the most lucrative
commercial casino outside of Nevada. The casino, which is
limited to electronic gaming devices and does not currently
offer table games or a sportsbook, reported annual gaming
revenue of $942.6 million, up 5.7 percent from the prior
year, surpassing the total generated by MGM National
Harbor casino in Maryland.

Gaming Tax Distribution

New York Effective Gaming Tax Rates

Sector Effective Gaming Tax Rate
Racino EGDs ~b5 percent
Casino EGDs 30 percent
Casino Table Games 10 percent
Casino Sports Betting 10 percent
Mobile Sports Betting 51 percent

New York commercial casinos and racinos are taxed at
different rates based on the location of the property and
the type of gaming the property offers.

Racinos, after paying out prizes and deducting vendor and
administrative expenses, retain approximately 45 percent
of their revenue.

Revenue from electronic gaming devices in New York’s
four commercial casino-resorts was taxed at 30 percent
in 2023, following the extension of a reduced tax rate
established by a 2022 state budget law to all four casino
properties in the market. Table game and sports betting
revenue generated by commercial casino-resorts is taxed
at 10 percent.

Revenue from mobile sports betting platforms is taxed at

a rate of 51 percent. Notably, unlike for the other forms of
commercial gaming in New York, the tax rate for mobile
sports betting was not defined by state law; instead,

51 percent was the rate that a group of nine successful
applicants agreed to pay through a competitive licensing
process. Land-based and mobile sportsbook operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied
to wagering handle.

In 2023, New York’s commercial casino gaming industry
generated approximately $2.07 billion in total state gaming
tax revenue, up 12.8 percent versus the previous year.

In total, mobile sports betting generated tax revenue of
around $861.8 million in 2023. The vast majority of that
tax revenue was dedicated to New York’s Education Fund,
which is used to provide aid for local school districts
across New York. In accordance with New York’s 2021
mobile sports betting law, additional sports betting tax
funds were set aside to fund problem gambling education
and treatment services, and to fund a statewide grant
program to support sports activities for underserved youth.

Electronic gaming devices at racinos generated
approximately $1.04 billion in total tax revenue for the
state’s Education Fund in 2023, while New York’s four
commercial casino-resorts generated approximately
$163.8 million in gaming tax revenue. Under state law, 80
percent of gaming tax revenue generated by casino-resorts
is used to fund statewide education programs or provide
property tax relief to New York citizens. The remainder is
distributed to local municipal and county governments that
either host or are located near commercial casino-resorts.

Competitive Landscape

As a result of the 2022 budget law that authorized
additional casinos in the New York City metro area, New
York’s commercial casino gaming market remains in a state
of flux.

That law will see up to three commercial casino-resorts
become licensed over the coming years, materially
expanding a downstate New York market that is currently
served by the Resorts World New York City and Empire
City racinos that are eligible to offer electronic gaming
devices but not table games or sports betting. Additional
expansion is also pending thanks to a separate law
