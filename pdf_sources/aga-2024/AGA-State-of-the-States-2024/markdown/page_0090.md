Gaming Tax Distribution

New Mexico commercial casino gaming revenue is taxed at
an effective rate of 46.25 percent.

In 2023, New Mexico commercial racinos generated total
gaming tax revenue of approximately $122.9 million, up
1.4 percent against the previous year.

Of that amount, $68.0 million was distributed to the
state’s General Fund, which is allocated each year for state
budgetary expenditures by the New Mexico Department of
Revenue, subject to approval by the state legislature.

An additional $54.2 million in commercial casino gaming
tax revenue was distributed to New Mexico’s horse racing
industry to supplement race purses, with the remainder
allocated to the funding of problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape

New Mexico commercial casinos face considerable
competition from the state’s 21 tribal casinos. Unlike

the state’s racinos, tribal casinos are permitted to offer
table games and sports betting in addition to electronic
gaming devices. During the state’s 2023 fiscal year ending
June 30, New Mexico tribal casinos generated $835.0
million in casino gaming revenue, an increase of 4.6
percent increase from 2022.

New Mexico racinos face more limited competition

from licensed non-profit organizations, such as veteran
and fraternal groups, which are authorized to operate a
maximum of 15 electronic gaming devices with restricted
payouts.

While state law provides for a sixth racino in the state,

the New Mexico Racing Commission in 2018 rejected all
applications for that final racetrack license and have yet to
resume the licensing process.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Regulatory Reform

In April, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) signed a bill

to increase the maximum jackpots that can be offered
by electronic gaming devices operating in New Mexico
fraternal and veterans halls. The legislation specifically
increased the maximum prize payout that can be offered
by each device from $4,000 to $10,000.

In August, the New Mexico Gaming Control Board
published draft regulations in order to implement the
statutory change on payouts alongside other revisions to
state rules applicable to electronic gaming devices at non-
profit locations.
