a third had received approval from the Louisiana Gaming
Control Board to begin construction.

In terms of out-of-state competition, casinos in
southeastern Louisiana compete directly with commercial
casinos in the Gulf Coast region of neighboring Mississippi

that have historically drawn a significant proportion of their

patrons from across the border.

Those in the Lake Charles and Shreveport/Bossier

regions have traditionally competed with tribal casinos

in Oklahoma to attract players from Texas, meaning they
would be vulnerable to losing patrons should lawmakers in
the Lone Star State eventually authorize casino gaming. In
2023, lawmakers in Texas again considered legislation to
authorize casinos, but a constitutional resolution to enable
commercial casino gaming failed to pass by the required
majority in the state’s House of Representatives.

Policy & Regulatory Review

Sports Betting

In June, then-Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill to
expressly prohibit Louisiana colleges and universities from
entering into marketing partnerships to promote any of the
state’s licensed sports betting operators.

The new legislation included exemptions for existing
marketing contracts already in place, as well as for

promotional campaigns exclusively directed at alumni
networks or to promote responsible gambling initiatives.

The chief sponsor of the bill noted that the legislation
aligned with the American Gaming Association’s
Responsible Marketing Code for Sports Wagering, which
was updated in March 2023. Similar state laws were also
approved in 2023 in Connecticut and Maryland.

Human Trafficking Awareness

Gov. Edwards signed a separate gaming bill in June to
require the state’s licensed casino gaming operators to
implement formal training programs on human trafficking
awareness and prevention, similar to the annual training
requirements applicable to casinos in various states for
responsible gaming and anti-money laundering, among
other topics.

The legislation also mandated the Louisiana Gaming
Control Board to adopt new regulations to set minimum
standards for annual human trafficking awareness for
casinos.

Further provisions of the gaming reform bill enabled
Louisiana’s licensed fantasy sports operators to apply

for a sports wagering license in the event that not all the
state’s casinos and racinos seek to obtain one. The bill
also reallocated a portion of annual state tax revenue from
sports betting to a problem gambling prevention fund.
