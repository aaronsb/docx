Gaming Tax Distribution

South Dakota applies a 9 percent tax on all commercial
casino gaming revenue, including revenue derived from
sports betting. The sportsbook operations of Deadwood
casinos are also subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise
tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, commercial casinos in South Dakota generated
total gaming tax revenue of approximately $12.6 million,
up 3.8 percent against the previous year.

Of the 9 percent of gaming revenue collected, 1 percent

is distributed to South Dakota’s General Fund, and the
remaining 8 percent is divided between the state’s Gaming
Commission Fund, the South Dakota Department of
Tourism, and Lawrence County where Deadwood is located.

The Gaming Commission Fund provides up to $6.8 million
annually to the City of Deadwood, and up to $100,000

to the State Historical Preservation Grant and Loan

Fund, with all remaining funds going to the state General
Fund, Lawrence County municipalities and schools,

and Deadwood historic preservation. In addition, the
Commission Fund is authorized to provide up to $30,000
annually for state gambling addiction programs.

Competitive Landscape

With almost two dozen casinos in Deadwood and no
major population center within hundreds of miles, South
Dakota relies heavily on tourists to patronize the historic
town’s commercial casinos. The wider South Dakota
gaming market also includes 13 tribal casinos spread
across the state, as well as a network of over 10,700
electronic gaming devices operated by the South Dakota

Lottery at more than 1,300 retail locations, such as bars
and taverns. In 2023, total statewide revenue from such
electronic gaming devices was $392.8 million, up 0.8
percent from the previous year.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

Proponents of online sports betting in South Dakota faced
another year of frustration in 2023.

In February, a constitutional resolution to authorize
statewide mobile sports betting was defeated on the floor of
the state’s House of Representatives by a 41-28 margin.

The legislative setback came after a similar constitutional
amendment was passed by the South Dakota Senate in
2022 but never brought up for a vote in the House. If a
measure on online sports betting is ultimately approved by
lawmakers, it would then be subject to a statewide voter
referendum.

Responsible Gaming

In March, the South Dakota Commission on Gaming
approved new regulations requiring Deadwood’s
commercial casinos to take additional measures to prevent
underage players from entering the casino floor.

The new rules specifically require each operator to have a
designated employee to ensure the casino has a full view
of any gaming conducted on the premises. Each casino
is also required to submit detailed procedures on how it
intends to control access to the gaming floor for formal
approval by the commission.
