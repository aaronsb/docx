Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape for commercial casino gaming
in lllinois was redrawn in 2023 with the opening of four
new casinos that were authorized under the 2019 gaming
expansion law.

New casino facilities were opened in Waukegan and
Danville in February and May, respectively, followed by
the opening of Walker’s Bluff Casino Resort in southern
[llinois in August. Bally’s Chicago Casino then opened

in September. Three of the four casinos—along with a
fifth new lllinois casino that opened in Rockford in late
2021—are currently operating as temporary facilities with
more limited gaming offerings while larger casino-resort
properties remain under development. Those permanent
casinos are set to open over the course of the next few
years.

Meanwhile, plans for another new land-based casino in
Chicago’s southern suburbs received preliminary approval
from the lllinois Gaming Board in late 2021. A temporary
facility is expected to open in either 2024 or 2025. In
addition, lllinois’ two active racetracks have applied for
licenses to offer electronic gaming devices and table
games at their facilities, also in accordance with the 2019
law.

Alongside expanding in-state competition, lllinois
commercial casinos in the Greater Chicago and East St.

gaming properties in northwestern Indiana and eastern
Missouri, respectively.

casino gaming industry comes from electronic gaming
devices—or video gaming terminals (VGTs)— that are
