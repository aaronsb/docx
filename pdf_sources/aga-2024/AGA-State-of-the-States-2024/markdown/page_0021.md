State By State Sports Betting Regulations, Taxes & Fees

At the close of 2023, legal sports betting was offered in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Five states—Kentucky,
Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska and Ohio—launched sports betting during the course of the year, while Florida’s
Seminole Tribe relaunched statewide sportsbook operations and mobile sports wagering went live in Delaware. Vermont
also legalized sports betting during the course of 2023 but did not launch operations, while North Carolina passed a law
to authorize mobile sports betting.
