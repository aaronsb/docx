ILLINOIS

revenue increased by 17.7 percent to $2.52 billion,
fueled by growth in online sports betting and the

opening of four new land-based casino properties.

Market Overview

[llinois offers commercial casino gaming at 10 riverboat casinos and five land-
based casinos under the regulation of the lllinois Gaming Board (IGB).

In 1990, the lllinois legislature approved the Riverboat Gambling Act, which
authorized the IGB to grant up to 10 riverboat casino licenses. A gaming law
passed in 2019 expanded the market by authorizing up to six new land-based
casinos in different areas of the state, including the City of Chicago, while also
permitting lllinois racetracks to apply for licenses to become racinos offering
electronic gaming devices and table games.

Additionally, the 2019 law legalized sports wagering at existing and future
casinos and racinos, as well as at up to three off-track betting facilities affiliated
with racinos and at major sports arenas across the state.

Casinos and racetracks are also eligible to operate statewide mobile sports
betting. At the end of 2023, legal sports betting was available at 12 retail
sportsbook locations and via eight online platforms, both up by one since the
start of the year.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.52 billion.
The record total was up 17.7 percent from the previous year and reflected
expansion of lllinois’ land-based casino market as well as ongoing maturation of
the state’s mobile sports betting market.
