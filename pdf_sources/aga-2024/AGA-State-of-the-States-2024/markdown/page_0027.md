Under the state’s 2021 legislation, all revenue generated
through sports betting “privilege fees,” or taxes, are
deposited on a monthly basis into Arizona’s General Fund
and used for general state budgetary purposes.

Competitive Landscape

Arizona’s commercial sports betting operations compete
with sportsbooks that can be offered in the state’s 27
tribal casinos in accordance with amendments to tribal
gaming compacts approved in 2021.

Aside from sports betting and tribal gaming, Arizona’s
broader gaming market includes a state lottery, charitable
bingo locations, three horse racetracks and around 60
off-track betting facilities offering wagering on horse and
dog races.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In August, the Arizona Department of Gaming opened a
new application window for operators to apply for a sports
wagering license.

Specifically, one license was available for an operator
partnered with an Arizona Indian tribe and two licenses
for operators partnered with an eligible professional sports
team in the state.

Under the terms of Arizona’s 2021 sports wagering
legislation, a total of 10 licenses are available for operators
to offer mobile and retail sports betting as the designated
partner of a sports team, with the same number available
to commercial operators serving as the online partner of an
Indian tribe with a tribal gaming compact.

The 2023 licensing window was opened by the Department
of Gaming because not all of the available licenses
established under the law were awarded during an initial
application period in 2021.

Following a two-week application window, the Arizona
regulator announced in late August that it had awarded
just one of the three available licenses to bet365 acting as
the designated partner of the Ak-Chin Indian Community.
