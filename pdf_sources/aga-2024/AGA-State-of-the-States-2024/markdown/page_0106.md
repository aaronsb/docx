The growth in traditional land-based casino gaming
revenue offset a year-over-year decline in sports betting
revenue.

Faced with a significant increase in regional competition
from the newly launched retail and mobile sportsbooks in
Massachusetts, sports betting revenue in Rhode Island
amounted to $40.3 million in 2023, down 18.3 percent
versus the prior year. Online sports betting accounted

for $30.7 million—or 76.3 percent—of the total, up 6.6
percent from 2022. In contrast, land-based sports betting
revenue was $9.6 million, less than half the prior-year total
of $20.5 million.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Rhode Island’s Bally’s Twin River Lincoln and Bally’s
Tiverton commercial casinos retain roughly 26 percent to
28.85 percent of their revenue from electronic gaming
devices, depending on each facility’s operating contract
and state regulation. An additional annual allowance

is made for certain marketing expenses. The state’s
overall take of electronic gaming device revenue, after
administrative and technology expenses are deducted, is
about 60 percent.

Casino table game revenue is taxed at a headline effective
rate of 16.5 percent, consisting of a 15.5 percent

*Revenue excludes contributions from sports betting

allocation to the state plus an additional 1 percent to the
casino’s host community.

Sports betting is taxed at an effective rate of 51 percent
with the remaining amount split between the operating
partners of the state lottery (32 percent) and the casino
hosting the sportsbook operation (17 percent).

In 2023, commercial casino gaming generated $357.3
million in total tax revenue for Rhode Island’s General Fund
and casinos’ host communities, up 3.0 percent versus

the previous year. Gaming revenue in the General Fund is
appropriated annually at the direction of the legislature
and is used to pay for various state services, including
education, public safety programs and healthcare.

By statute, the towns of Lincoln and Tiverton are also
entitled to receive a minimum of $3 million in annual
commissions for hosting electronic gaming devices and
table games, plus an additional $200,000 for hosting
sports betting.

Competitive Landscape

Rhode Island’s commercial casinos compete directly with
Plainridge Park Casino in Massachusetts, which is just
20 miles from Providence, as well as the Foxwoods and
Mohegan Sun tribal casinos in southeastern Connecticut.
Since mid 2019, New England casinos have faced a
substantial increase in competition for players from the
Greater Boston area in the form of the Encore Boston
Harbor casino-resort, located in Everett, Massachusetts.

A fourth Massachusetts casino is also authorized under

a 2011 gaming law for the state’s southeastern region
that borders Rhode Island. However, a planned tribal
casino-resort has been stalled by legal challenges and
Massachusetts regulators have to date declined to license
an alternative commercial casino in the region.

Following the launch of legal sports betting in
Massachusetts in early 2023, both Rhode Island’s
bordering states offer a full range of retail and mobile
sports wagering. iGaming is also available in Connecticut.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming

In June, Gov. Dan McKee (D) signed legislation making
Rhode Island the eighth state to authorize iGaming.

The legislation signed by the governor specifically provides
for a joint venture between the state’s incumbent land-
based casino operator and its primary lottery system
provider to offer digital versions of traditional casino games
to players throughout Rhode Island. The new law was set
to take formal effect in March 2024.
