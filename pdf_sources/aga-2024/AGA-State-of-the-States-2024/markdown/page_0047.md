Competitive Landscape

Indiana’s commercial casinos and racinos operate in a
midwestern gaming market that is becoming increasingly
competitive as a result of recent expansion in lllinois, as
well as the rollout of legal sports betting across the region.

Casinos in northwestern Indiana that have historically
sought to attract patrons from the Greater Chicago area
faced additional competition in 2023 from the first

casino property located within Chicago city limits, which
opened in September. Operations at the Bally’s Chicago
Casino is currently limited to a temporary facility while a
larger casino-resort remains under development. Another
Chicago-area casino, located in the city’s southern suburbs,
is also scheduled to open in mid-2024, having similarly
been authorized by lllinois’ 2019 gaming expansion law.

Elsewhere, commercial casinos in northern Indiana
compete with one tribal casino in the city of South Bend
that pursuant to a 2021 tribal gaming compact offers a
full range of electronic gaming devices, table games and
sports betting, having previously been limited to electronic
bingo games.

Riverboat casinos in southeastern Indiana compete with
a trio of Ohio casinos and racinos serving the Greater
Cincinnati market, while casinos in southeastern and
southern Indiana also face growing competition from
the expansion of historical horse racing devices at
racing venues in Kentucky. Those properties in Ohio and
Kentucky were all able to start offering sports betting
during 2023.

Within Indiana, a 13th commercial casino property is
scheduled to open in 2024 in the city of Terre Haute near
the state’s western border with lllinois. The casino was
authorized under a 2019 state law that allowed for one
casino license in northwestern Indiana to be relocated to a
location in Vigo County. Local voters approved the casino
in a November 2019 referendum and the Indiana Gaming
Commission eventually awarded a license for the project in
late 2021.
