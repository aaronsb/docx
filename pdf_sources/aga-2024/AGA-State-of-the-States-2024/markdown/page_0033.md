Connecticut’s iGaming and sports betting markets

CONNECTICUT

generated total revenue of $579.9 million in 2023, up
39.3 percent from the prior year. iGaming accounted

for 70.1 percent of the total.

Market Overview

Connecticut has no commercial casino venues but offers iGaming through
commercial internet casinos affiliated with the state’s two sovereign tribal
nations, the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot.

Sports betting is also offered by three online sportsbook platforms affiliated
with the two tribes or with the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. The state
lottery is also eligible to offer in-person sports betting at up to 15 land-based
locations, of which 10 were operational at the end of 2023.

Both iGaming and sports betting were legalized by a May 2021 law that granted
the governor authority to renegotiate the state’s tribal gaming compacts to
accommodate the new offerings of sports wagering, iGaming, fantasy sports and
online lottery games.

Commercial gaming in Connecticut is regulated by the state’s Department of
Consumer Protection.
