Regulatory Reform

Maine gaming regulators approved amendments to several
of the state’s casino gaming regulations in 2023.

In October, the Maine Gambling Control Unit adopted new
regulations governing the self-exclusion programs offered
by the state’s two commercial casinos. The regulator in
March adopted revised minimum internal control standards

for casino gaming, which it said reflected technological
advances made since initial standards were approved in
2004.

In November, the Gambling Control Unit also adopted
new rules for fantasy sports contests to amend reporting
and licensing requirements applicable to fantasy contest
operators.
