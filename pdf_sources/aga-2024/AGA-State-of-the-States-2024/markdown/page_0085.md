The vast majority of that total was distributed to the New
Hampshire Education Trust Fund, which provides grants
to the state’s local school districts. Other funds were
allocated to cover administrative costs and to fund a state
responsible gambling council that was established under
the 2019 sports betting law.

Competitive Landscape

New Hampshire's retail and mobile sportsbooks operate

in a New England sports betting market that became
increasingly competitive during 2023. Following approval
of new laws in 2022, Massachusetts launched retail sports
betting in January followed by online sports betting in
March, while mobile sports betting went live in Maine in
November. Neighboring Vermont also passed legislation

to authorize online sports betting in June 2023, with
operations due to commence in early 2024.

Aside from sports betting, New Hampshire's broader
gaming market includes a racetrack and simulcast
facilities, as well as 14 charitable gaming locations that
are authorized to operate electronic bingo devices and
historical horse racing terminals, among other games.
The New Hampshire Lottery also offers a range of online
lottery games.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming

In March, the New Hampshire Senate voted to pass a bill
to authorize iGaming in the state under the oversight of the
New Hampshire Lottery Commission.

The bill approved by senators specifically would have
authorized the commission to hold a procurement process
to select one or more private operators to conduct iGaming
on its behalf. Only online versions of casino table games
would be permitted, and not games replicating those of an
electronic gaming device.

After narrowly passing the Senate by a one-vote margin,
the bill was abruptly shelved in the New Hampshire House
of Representatives. During Senate hearings, lawmakers
received testimony from operators of charitable gaming

in New Hampshire who expressed concern that iGaming
could cannibalize revenue from their land-based facilities.

Regulatory Reform

In June, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) signed a bill to allow
for higher stakes games in New Hampshire’s charitable
gaming locations.

Among other statutory changes, the legislation specifically
increased the maximum wager for a table game at a
charitable casino from $10 to $50. The bill also raised the
maximum amount a player may spend during the course of
a single game from $150 to $2,500.

The new legislation was the latest in a series of initiatives
to bolster New Hampshire's charitable gaming sector.
After lawmakers approved a law in 2021 to permit
electronic gaming devices based on historical horse races
at charitable casinos, Gov. Sununu signed legislation the
following year to also authorize extended opening hours for
charitable gaming facilities.
