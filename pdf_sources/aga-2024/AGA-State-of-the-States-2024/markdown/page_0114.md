Policy & Regulatory Review
Expansion

In November, local voters in Richmond rejected a
referendum on a proposed casino-resort to be sited
in Virginia's capital city. It was the second time that
Richmond voters had rejected a casino, following the
defeat of an initial referendum two years earlier.

The outcome of the second referendum was set to renew
debate in the Virginia General Assembly over potential
alternative locations for one of the five casinos authorized
under a 2020 gaming expansion law.

Legislation to authorize a casino at an alternative site in
the nearby city of Petersburg was proposed during the
2023 session but not approved by lawmakers, despite
plans announced by one casino company to develop a $1.4
billion Petersburg casino-resort.

Also in November, local voters in the city of Manassas Park
rejected a separate referendum initiative to authorize a
gaming facility featuring electronic gaming devices based
on the outcome of historical horse races.

Illegal Gaming

In 2023, two separate court decisions made in October
and November reinforced a statewide ban on unregulated
electronic gaming devices purporting to offer games of
skill.

The first ruling by the Virginia Supreme Court overturned a
lower court’s injunction to prevent enforcement of a 2021
ban on the devices offered in gas stations, convenience
stores, bars and other locations across the state. In
November, a separate court ruling granted the state’s
motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging that prohibition on
constitutional grounds.

Electronic gaming devices supposedly offering skill
games were prohibited in 2021 following the expiration
of a temporary registration system to govern the devices.
Virginia lawmakers have since passed additional laws to
firm up state laws on illegal gaming.

Responsible Gaming

In March, Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) signed a bill to
establish a new problem gambling advisory council
within the state’s Department of Behavioral Health and
Developmental Services.

The new law specifically directed the commissioner of
the department to set up a new committee to ensure
collaboration between prevention and treatment providers
and commercial gaming operators in efforts to reduce the
negative effects of problem gambling in Virginia.

The new committee met for the first time in July and
includes representatives from the Virginia Council on
Problem Gambling, state regulatory agencies, plus
operators of casinos, sports betting, historical horse racing
and charitable gaming.
