Montana faces limited regional competition for sports
betting in the shape of online sports wagering platforms
that are available on a statewide basis in southern
neighbor Wyoming, as well as land-based sportsbook
operations at commercial casinos in the city of Deadwood
in South Dakota.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In February, Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) signed a bill to clarify
the rulemaking authority of the Montana Lottery to adjust

sales commissions and other policies applicable to the
host locations for its sports betting program.

The new legislation expressly granted the Montana Lottery
Commission the authority to adopt new policies for

sports wagering sales agents without requiring a broader
administrative process.

The bill was approved after the Montana Lottery acted

in 2022 to halve the commission rate payable to the
licensed bars and other locations that host Sports Bet
Montana kiosks, as part of a broader restructuring that
also involved the lottery lowering its hold rate in order to
provide more attractive odds to players. Host locations now
receive 3 percent of all amounts bet through kiosks at their
properties, versus an initial 6 percent commission rate.
