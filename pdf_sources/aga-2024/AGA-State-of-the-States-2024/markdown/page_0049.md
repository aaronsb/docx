Total statewide commercial gaming revenue reached

a record $1.95 billion in 2023, as continued growth in

lowa’s online sports betting market offset declines in

revenue from traditional casino games and land-based

sports wagering.

Market Overview

lowa offers commercial casino gaming at 15 land-based casinos, three riverboat
casinos and one racino. The 19 properties, all of which operate electronic
gaming devices, table games and sports betting, are regulated by the lowa
Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC).

In 1989, lowa became the first state to legalize riverboat casinos with the
passage of the Excursion Gambling Boat Act. Electronic gaming devices at
racetracks were authorized in 1994, with table games approved in 2005.
lowa’s commercial casinos and racinos were authorized to offer land-based
and online sports betting by a law passed in 2019. At the conclusion of 2023,
sports betting was available at each of lowa’s 19 commercial casino locations
as well as through 17 affiliated mobile sports wagering platforms, down from
18 platforms in the previous year.

There are no statutory limits on the number of commercial casinos that may
operate in lowa. However, counties seeking to host a casino or racino must
secure the approval of a majority of its residents via a county-wide referendum.
A second voter referendum is required eight years after initial approval.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $1.95 billion,
up 0.8 percent versus the previous year and setting a new annual revenue
record for lowa.
