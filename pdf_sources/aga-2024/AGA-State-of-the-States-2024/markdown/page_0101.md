In accordance with state law, the Oregon Lottery transfers
its profits to specific programs as determined by the state
legislature. Programs funded by Oregon Lottery profits
include education and veterans services, state parks,
conservation projects and economic-growth initiatives.

Competitive Landscape

The Oregon Lottery faces competition for sports bettors
from sportsbook operations at several tribal casinos within
the state. Certain Oregon Indian tribes are permitted to
operate sports betting in their tribal casinos because of
language in their tribal-state gaming compacts which
permits the tribe to offer any form of casino gaming that
has already been approved in Nevada. Sports betting is
also available at tribal casinos in neighboring Washington.

In addition to sports betting and the state’s 10 tribal
casinos, Oregon’s gaming market includes horse racing,
as well as more than 10,600 electronic gaming devices
(VLTs) operated by the Oregon Lottery at 2,013 bars and
other retail locations. In 2023, total statewide revenue
these VLTs was $1.18 billion, down 2.1 percent from the
previous year.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Legislative Oversight

In January, the Oregon House of Representatives confirmed
the appointment of a permanent committee on gambling

regulation to have primary oversight and lawmaking
responsibilities for all matters related to gaming in the state.

The new permanent committee was formed after an
interim committee made up of both House and Senate
members was disbanded at the end of 2022.

During the 2023 session, the House Committee on
Gambling Regulation held 16 meetings and evaluated five
specific pieces of legislation related to the distribution

of state lottery revenue, greyhound racing and proposed
studies of the Oregon gaming market. None of the
measures was approved, however.

Expansion

In June, the Oregon Lottery Commission approved new
regulations to lift a moratorium on the expansion of the
lottery’s network of state-operated electronic gaming
devices (video lottery terminals or VLTs) to additional
retail locations across the state. The moratorium had
been in place since 2021, limiting the Oregon Lottery’s
VLT program to approximately 2,000 existing retail
establishments.

Under the new rules, retail locations are eligible to apply

to be on a waiting list to become a VLT host location. Any
location must have been open for business for at least nine
months prior to hosting VLTs. Meanwhile, Oregon video
lottery retailers are required under the new rules to receive a
minimum of $10,000 in weekly wagering volume per device
and those locations that fail to meet that threshold risk
having one of their devices reallocated to another location.
The prior weekly sales threshold was less than $2,700.
