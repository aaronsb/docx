revenue was impacted by a lengthy labor dispute at Detroit’s
three casino properties during the final quarter of the year.

Commercial sports betting revenue was $434.4 million,
up 3.8 percent, with mobile sports betting accounting
for $420.4 million—or 96.8 percent—of the total. Retail
sportsbooks in the three Detroit casinos generated some
$14.1 million in revenue, down 26.3 percent from 2022.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Land-based casino gaming revenue is taxed at 19 percent
for electronic gaming devices and table games, with 10.9
percent directed to the host city of Detroit and 8.1 percent
allocated for the state. Revenue from land-based sports
betting is subject to an effective tax rate of 8.4 percent.

In addition to revenue-based taxes, casinos are required

to remit annual services fees to state and municipal
governments.

Revenue from iGaming is subject to a graduated tax rate
that ranges from 20 percent on revenue less than $4
million, to 28 percent on revenue exceeding $12 million,
with limited deductions for promotional credits offered to
patrons. Internet casinos affiliated with the three Detroit
commercial casinos are also required to pay a municipal
fee of 1.25 percent.

Revenue from online sports betting is taxed at 8.4 percent,
applied after deductions of free bets and other bonuses
and promotions. Online sportsbooks affiliated with the
Detroit casinos pay the same 1.25 percent municipal tax
as internet gaming, while online sports betting operations
are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Michigan’s three commercial casinos and its
regulated iGaming and online sports betting platforms
generated estimated total gaming tax revenue of $821.3
million, up 11.9 percent from 2022. Of this amount,
approximately $510.3 million was remitted to the state,
with $267.8 million going to the Detroit city government.
A further $43.1 million in iGaming taxes was transfered to
tribal governments.

The City of Detroit uses the gaming taxes it receives to
fund a variety of public needs, including law enforcement,
public safety programs, economic development and job
creation programs, anti-gang and youth development
programs, tax relief, and infrastructure improvements.
Most gaming tax revenue that the state receives is
allocated to the Michigan School Aid Fund, which benefits
K-12 public education. Additional portions of tax revenue
generated by iGaming are appropriated for first-responder
programs and problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to commercial casinos in Detroit, Michigan’s
broader gaming market includes 23 tribal casinos
operated by 12 sovereign tribal nations, which are located
throughout the state. The three commercial casinos also
compete directly with a casino-resort in Windsor, Ontario
located on the opposite bank of the Detroit River.

Due to a state constitutional amendment passed in 2004,
any new commercial casino gaming facility, or the addition
of casino gaming at existing venues such as racetracks,

must first receive the approval of a majority of voters both
statewide and in the locality where gaming will take place.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Illegal Gaming

Michigan authorities took a series of actions to tackle
unregulated gaming during the course of 2023.

In the latter months of the year, the Michigan Gaming
Control Board issued a series of cease-and-desist letters
to the operators of three prominent sweepstakes gaming
platforms. Although the companies in question claim to
operate lawfully in most states across the country, the
