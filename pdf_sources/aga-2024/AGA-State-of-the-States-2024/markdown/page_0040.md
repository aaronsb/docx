mobile sportsbook platform. In August, the Delaware
Lottery announced that BetRivers operator Rush Street
Interactive had been selected as its chosen vendor. The
BetRivers sportshook and online casino, co-branded with
all three of Delaware’s land-based racinos, was soft-
launched towards the end of December.

The Delaware Lottery’s expansion into mobile sports
betting ran in parallel with a review of the state’s policy
options in the area by members of the state legislature.

In January, the Delaware House of Representatives passed
a resolution to establish a four-member working group

to evaluate regulatory models for online sports betting

in other states and provide recommendations for the full
House to consider.

The working group’s report was published in December
and recommended that Delaware consider a model that
involves competition among multiple licensed online sports
betting operators, rather than one single platform.
