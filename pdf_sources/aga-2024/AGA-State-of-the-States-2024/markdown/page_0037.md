Payments Modernization

In November, the District of Columbia Office of Lottery
and Gaming (OLG) published a guidance memo to clarify

that in-person sports wagers made at licensed sportsbook
locations can be made using credit or debit cards, in
addition to cash.

The cityâ€™s sports wagering law expressly allows for use of
cards for online sports betting, but the OLG said it had
regulatory authority to permit card-based transactions for
both retail and online wagers. Sportsbook operators were
required to submit a request for permission and update
their internal control procedures in order to offer card-
based transactions at land-based locations, according to
the memo.
