on Indian lands in the city of Taunton, some 20 miles from
Plainridge Park Casino. As of the end of 2023, construction
of the tribal casino remained on hold due to a series of
lengthy legal challenges against the project. A second
Massachusetts Indian tribe, the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay
Head (Aquinnah), is also pursuing development of a more
modest gaming facility limited to electronic bingo devices on
the island of Martha’s Vineyard.

From a sports betting perspective, thanks to the approval
of legislation in Vermont in 2023, each of Massachusetts’
bordering states either offered or would soon offer mobile
sports wagering.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In late January, Massachusetts became the 33rd state
with legal sports betting when land-based sportsbooks
were opened at all three of the state’s land-based casino
gaming facilities. Mobile sports betting was launched
around six weeks later.

The year also saw the Massachusetts Gaming Commission
continue its rulemaking process to fully implement the
state’s 2022 sports betting law.

The commission approved an official catalog of permitted
wagering events just prior to the launch of legal sports
betting in January. The agency also held a series of public
consultation processes before adopting a range of updated
regulations related to sports betting advertising, affiliate
marketing, player management programs and data privacy
protections, among other areas.

Responsible Gaming

In August, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission opened
a request for information process to explore the potential
of Al-driven technology solutions to identify potential
problem gambling behaviors in online sports betting and
land-based casino gaming in the state.

The information gathering process was the first step in the
development of a strategic approach to the potential use of
Al and other technologies to prevent problem gambling by

monitoring play patterns.

Massachusetts already has a unique responsible gaming
solution for casinos through its PlayMyWay system that

enables patrons to set limits on the amount they wish to
spend via electronic gaming devices at the state’s land-

based casino properties.
