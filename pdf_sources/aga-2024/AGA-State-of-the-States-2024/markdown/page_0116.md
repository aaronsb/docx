state’s highest since 2012, when a competing casino-
resort opened in neighboring Maryland.

Annual revenue from traditional casino games at West
Virginia's four racinos and lone land-based casino was
$600.5 million, up 1.3 percent versus 2022, as growth in
revenue from electronic gaming devices offset a decline in
table game revenue. Total revenue from electronic gaming
devices was $497.0 million, up 2.3 percent, whereas table
game revenue was $103.6 million, down 3.4 percent from
the previous year.

The principal driver of overall revenue growth, however,
was iGaming. Total revenue from iGaming in 2023 was
$157.5 million, up 39.9 percent versus the equivalent
figure from 2022.

In contrast, sports betting revenue fell by approximately
6.0 percent to $47.8 million in 2023, reflective of
expanded competition from sports betting operations in
neighboring states Kentucky, Maryland and Ohio.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Revenue from electronic gaming devices at West Virginia's
five casino properties is subject to an effective tax rate of
53.5 percent, while table games are taxed at 35 percent.

The tax rate for iGaming is 15 percent, with sports betting
subject to a state tax of 10 percent of revenue. Sportsbook
operations are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal
excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, West Virginia's commercial casinos and affiliated
online sports betting and internet gaming platforms
generated total gaming tax revenue of $311.0 million, an
increase of 4.0 percent from the prior year.

The majority of gaming tax revenue is remitted to the
state government, including to funds associated with the
West Virginia Lottery. Lottery funds are allocated to the
state’s public schools, tourism promotion, state parks,
and services for senior citizens. County and municipal
governments also receive a small percentage of gaming
tax proceeds, as do West Virginia's horse and greyhound
racing industries.

Taxes collected from sports betting are placed in the
West Virginia Lottery Sports Wagering Fund, which
distributes the first $15 million to the State Lottery Fund
before remaining monies are used to help support health-
insurance programs for public sector employees.

Internet gaming taxes are similarly deposited into the
West Virginia Lottery Interactive Wagering Fund. The fund
distributes annual tax profits to the State Lottery Fund,
following deductions for regulatory costs and contributions
to the pensions of West Virginia racing employees.

Competitive Landscape

West Virginia’s commercial casinos compete directly with
casino properties in several neighboring states. Hollywood
Casino at Charles Town Races competes with three
Maryland casinos for patrons from the Greater Washington
D.C.-Baltimore area, while Wheeling Island Hotel Casino
Racetrack and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack & Resort
both face competition from casinos and racinos around
Pittsburgh and in eastern Ohio. Up to five land-based
casinos have also been authorized in neighboring Virginia,
although none for locations near the West Virginia border.

Following the launch of legal sports betting in Kentucky
and Ohio in 2023, West Virginia is surrounded by five
bordering states that all offer a full range of land-based
and mobile sports wagering. Only Pennsylvania also offers
iGaming, however.

Within the state, West Virginia's commercial casinos

also compete with a network of nearly 8,200 limited-
stakes electronic gaming devices (VLTs) situated at retail
establishments, such as bars and taverns. In 2023, total
statewide revenue from these VLTs was $493.6 million, up
1.2 percent from the previous year.
