In contrast, table game revenue at casinos was $286.1
million, down 5.8 percent compared to the prior year.

Including revenue from retail sportsbook operations, Ohio’s
four casino-resorts located in the downtown areas of the

pay a slightly higher 33.5 percent effective tax rate on
their revenue from electronic gaming devices.

In accordance with a 2023 state budget law, revenue from
both land-based and online sports betting is taxed at a rate
of 20 percent. Sportsbook operations are further subject
to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied to wagering
handle.

In 2023, Ohio’s casinos, racinos and sports betting
operations generated total state gaming tax revenue of
approximately $929.9 million, up 19.1 percent from the
prior year. Taxes applied to electronic gaming devices and
table games at Ohio’s four casinos accounted for $333.5
million of the total, while electronic gaming devices at
racinos generated $462.8 million. Land-based and online
sports betting generated approximately $133.6 million in
state tax revenue in its first year of operation.

Roughly 50 percent of land-based casino tax revenue is
distributed to Ohio’s 88 county governments to support
local budgetary needs, including law enforcement,
infrastructure improvements and other public services.
Another 34 percent is earmarked for the Ohio Student
Fund, which distributes dollars to all school districts, while
5 percent is returned to the host cities where casinos are
located. The remaining funds are used to treat problem
gambling and cover the costs of the agencies that regulate
gaming in Ohio.

Under Ohio law, all tax revenue generated by electronic
gaming devices at racinos must be used for the purpose
of funding state education programs. Accordingly, racino
tax revenue flows into the Lottery Profits Education Fund,
which supports primary and secondary schools in Ohio.
Additionally, 0.5 percent of racino commissions from
electronic gaming devices are allocated to support state
treatment programs for problem gambling.

The vast majority of sports betting tax revenue, after
reimbursement of the state’s direct regulatory costs, is
distributed to an education fund that supports public and
non-public K-12 education programs via appropriations
made by the state legislature. Two percent of sports
betting tax revenue is also set aside for a state problem
gambling fund.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to fierce competition among the casinos and
racinos within the state, various Ohio casino gaming
properties also compete for patrons with gaming venues
located in neighboring markets.

Casinos and racinos in the Cincinnati area compete with
a trio of riverboat casinos stationed on the Indiana side of
the Ohio River and with two Kentucky racetrack facilities
that offer electronic gaming devices based on historical
