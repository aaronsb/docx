Annual U.S. Sports Betting Revenue

Amid continued expansion into new states, the regulated
U.S. sports betting market generated total revenue

of $11.04 billion in 2023, not including sportsbook
operations in tribal casinos, an increase of 46.0 percent
from the prior year.

In its first full year with mobile sports betting, New York
reported total sports wagering revenue of nearly $1.70
billion, accounting for more than 15 percent of the national
total. After a modest decline in 2022, New Jersey’s sports
betting market rebounded in 2023 to report total revenue
of slightly over $1 billion and regained its position as the
second largest in the country, just ahead of lllinois. After
launching on January 1, Ohio reported total sports betting
revenue of $936.6 million to quickly become the fourth
largest sports betting state in the U.S.

In addition to Ohio, legal sports betting operations also
began in 2023 in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Kentucky and
Maine. Legislation to regulate mobile sports wagering was
approved in Vermont and North Carolina.

Growth was not spread evenly between mobile and land-
based sportsbook operations in 2023. While revenue from
online or mobile sports betting increased by around 50
percent to approximately $10.4 billion, annual land-based
sports wagering revenue, excluding revenue from tribal-
operated sportsbooks, was down by around 5.8 percent
relative to the prior year.

Responsible Advertising

A key policy priority for the commercial casino gaming
industry and state policymakers in 2023 was establishing
heightened standards to ensure responsible advertising of
casino gaming, especially sports betting.

New rules applicable to sports betting advertising

were adopted in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New
York, while policymakers in Connecticut, Louisiana and
Maryland also passed laws to limit marketing partnerships
between sports wagering operators and local colleges and
universities.

The new restrictions on advertising via college
partnerships, among other policies adopted by states, were
broadly consistent with the AGA’s Responsible Marketing
Code for Sports Wagering, which was updated in March to
add further limits on marketing to college-aged audiences
and prevent use of certain misleading terms in all ads.

Illegal Gaming

Another central policy focus among state lawmakers and
law enforcement officials in 2023 was tackling illicit
competition from unregulated and illegal gaming operations,
including of so-called “skill machines.”

New legislation to prohibit unregulated electronic

gaming devices was approved in Kentucky, while similar
legislation approved in 2020 in Virginia was upheld after

a longstanding court challenge. However, lawmakers

and regulators in various other states, including lllinois,
Pennsylvania and Missouri, continued to debate how

to confront unregulated gaming devices that generate
estimated annual revenue of up to $44.2 billion, according
to AGA research.

Elsewhere, regulators in Colorado, Michigan and New York
all adopted new rules in 2023 to prevent fantasy sports
operators from offering contests that mimic certain types
of sports betting, while Michigan took enforcement actions
against operators providing online casino games under the
guise of sweepstakes contests.

The ongoing challenge of illegal competition faced by

the regulated commercial casino gaming industry was
highlighted in an April joint letter submitted to the U.S.
Attorney General by the chief gaming regulatory officials of
seven states calling for a heightened focus by federal law
enforcement in tackling offshore illegal gambling.
