Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices
was $424.7 million, up 4.8 percent against 2022, but
table game revenue was $53.7 million, down 3.4 percent.
Revenue from iGaming was $14.1 million, up 3.3 percent
from the previous year.

Facing a first full-year of competition from mobile sports
wagering in neighboring Maryland, sports betting revenue
again declined in 2023. Total revenue reported by
Delaware racinos’ sports wagering operations and sports
lottery parlays was $14.5 million, a decline of 16.0 percent
from the previous year.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Delaware’s commercial casinos are subject to an effective
tax rate of approximately 56 percent on their gross revenue
from electronic gaming devices and a 20 percent tax on
their gross table game revenue, both inclusive of payments
used to subsidize race purses.

The effective taxation structure applied to iGaming offerings
is roughly the same as the structure applied to the
equivalent games in racinos. However, racinos are entitled
to a share of internet gaming revenue only after the total
amount generated in any year surpasses $3.75 million.

DELAWARE: COMMERCIAL GAMING REVENUE (US$M)
2010 to 2023

While iGaming and sports betting have become major
segments of the commercial casino gaming industry in
neighboring states such as Pennsylvania, traditional land-
based casino games continued to account for more than 94
percent of total casino gaming revenue in Delaware in 2023.

Meanwhile, Delaware racinos retain approximately 40
percent of revenue from sports betting. The state keeps 50
percent of revenue but must pay additional commissions to
providers of the Delaware Lottery’s sports betting system
and risk-management services. Approximately 10 percent
of sports betting revenue is distributed to the local horse
racing industry.

In 2023, Delaware’s racinos and sports lottery retailers
generated total gaming tax revenue of approximately
$235.4 million, up 4.6 percent versus the previous year.

Of the total tax revenue generated by commercial

gaming operations in 2023, approximately $184 million
was returned to Delaware’s General Fund. Those funds
appropriated annually for various purposes, including
public and higher education, health and social services
and public safety. Approximately $51 million of gaming
tax revenue was directed Delaware’s racing industry for the
purpose of supplementing race purses.

Competitive Landscape

Delaware racinos compete in a crowded Mid-Atlantic
market that includes more than two-dozen commercial
casinos in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Delaware Park Casino, located near Wilmington,
directly competes for patrons in a Greater Philadelphia
market served by five casinos and racinos.

While Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to
offer legal sports betting following the 2018 ruling of the
U.S. Supreme Court, land-based and online sportsbook
operations are now available in all three of its bordering
states since the launch of mobile sports wagering in
Maryland in late 2022. In part due to the expanded
regional competition, the Delaware Lottery launched its own
online sports betting operation in late December 2023.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

More than five years after launching land-based sports
betting at its racinos, Delaware expanded its sports
wagering market in late December through the launch of
a BetRivers-branded mobile sportsbook platform offered
via a partnership with the Delaware Lottery and the state’s
three racino operators.

The launch of the online sports betting offering followed
a procurement process conducted by the state lottery
to select a new primary technology partner to support
Delaware’s existing iGaming operations as well as a new
