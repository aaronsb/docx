The record total primarily reflected the addition of legal
sports betting to Maine’s commercial casino gaming
market. After launching in early November, Maine’s online
sports betting operators generated $9.2 million in revenue
in 2023.

Revenue from traditional land-based casino games was
essentially flat from the prior year.

Electronic gaming devices at Maine’s two commercial
casino properties generated a total of $142.1 million in
revenue in 2023, up 1.6 percent compared to 2022.
That offset a decline in table game revenue, which fell
5.9 percent to $23.8 million. Overall land-based casino
gaming revenue was $165.9 million in 2023 versus
$165.1 million in 2022.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Maine’s two commercial casinos are subject to different
tax rates. Hollywood Casino, as a racino property, pays
39 percent of electronic gaming device revenue and

1 percent of electronic gaming device handle in taxes,
while Oxford Casino, as a standalone casino, is subject
to a tax rate of 46 percent of electronic gaming device
revenue. Both casinos pay 16 percent of their table game
revenue in taxes.

In 2023, Maine’s commercial casinos generated total
gaming tax revenue of $70.1 million, up 2.7 percent from
the previous year.

The biggest recipients of gaming tax dollars in Maine

are the state’s Department of Education to support K-12
school programs, scholarship programs to state and
community colleges, and a state fund established in 2000
to provide prevention-related services and other healthcare
programs for Maine families. Gaming tax revenue is also
distributed to support the state’s horse racing industry,
agricultural programs and the local governments that host
commercial casinos.

Competitive Landscape

Maine’s commercial casinos operate at the outer edge

of a New England market that includes commercial and
tribal casino-resorts in Connecticut, Massachusetts

and Rhode Island. The state’s casinos also face cross-
border competition from charitable gaming locations

in neighboring New Hampshire, which are able to offer
electronic gaming devices based on the outcome of
historical horse races as well as table games with limited
stakes.

Maine’s wider gaming market also includes six racing and
off-track betting facilities. While these locations do not
currently offer any form of casino gaming, they are eligible
to offer retail sports wagering alongside Oxford Casino and
Hollywood Casino Bangor, in accordance with legislation
approved by Maine lawmakers in 2022. Similarly, Maine
is home to four federally recognized Indian tribes that

do not operate casino gaming on Indian lands, but they
are permitted to offer statewide mobile sports betting in
partnership with specialist sportsbook operators.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

Maine regulators took a series of steps in 2023 to prepare
for the launch of legal sports betting.

In October, the Maine Gambling Control Unit adopted
regulations to fully implement the 2022 law that
authorized retail and online sports wagering in Maine. The
rules’ adoption followed a consultation process on draft
regulations that were initially released in January. Notably,
the final regulations included a series of restrictions related
to advertising, but not a proposal for television advertising
to be limited strictly to live sports event broadcasts.

Mobile sports betting was launched in early November
through two online betting platforms—Caesars Sportsbook
and DraftKings—operating via partnerships with Maine
Indian tribes in accordance with the 2022 legislation.
