proposed updated regulations designed to prevent
potentially fraudulent account activity through the state’s
mobile sportsbook platforms.

Among other things, the proposed rules would require
operators to display pop-up notices to warn patrons that
account-sharing is prohibited and that it is an offense
for any person to circumvent account registration
requirements or to assist in the placing of a wager by a
minor aged under 21.
