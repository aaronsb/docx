Market Overview

Maryland offers commercial casino gaming at five land-based casinos and
one racino, each of which is eligible to operate electronic gaming devices,
table games and sports betting. The casinos are regulated by the Maryland
Lottery and Gaming Control Agency and Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control
Commission.

Commercial casino gaming was first approved in 2008 when Maryland voters
passed a constitutional amendment allowing a total of five casinos limited to
electronic gaming devices. The market expanded in 2012 when lawmakers and
voters authorized table games at all casino properties as well as a license for a
sixth commercial casino in Prince George’s County, near Washington D.C.

Sports betting was approved by voters in 2020 and authorized via a state
law enacted the following year. That law allowed for retail sports wagering at
Maryland’s commercial casinos, major sports stadiums and at various other
locations. Up to 60 state licenses for mobile sports betting were also made
available. Land-based sports betting was launched at Maryland commercial
casinos in late 2021, followed by mobile sports betting in November 2022.
At the end of 2023, sports wagering was available at 13 retail locations and
via 12 mobile sportsbook platforms, up from nine retail locations and seven
mobile platforms a year earlier.
