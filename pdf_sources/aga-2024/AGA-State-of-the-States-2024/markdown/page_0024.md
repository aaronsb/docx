According to statistics published by the National Indian
Gaming Commission, revenue from tribal gaming operations
surpassed $40 billion for the first time in FY2022 to reach
a record total of $40.94 billion. The total was up 4.9
percent compared to the prior year. Comparable revenue
statistics for 2023 will be published by the NIGC later

in 2024. When tribal gaming revenue is combined with
reported commercial casino gaming revenue, it is expected
that total U.S. gaming revenue for 2023 will approach
$110 billion.
