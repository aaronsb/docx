ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report provides a comprehensive, annual overview of
the commercial casino gaming industry in each of the 36
jurisdictions with legal commercial casino gaming or sports
betting as of December 31, 2023.

For each of the jurisdictions, the report analyzes gaming
revenue and gaming taxes generated by commercial casino
locations, as well as sports betting and iGaming platforms,
for the calendar year 2023. In addition, the report provides
an overview of the primary competition faced by the
gaming industry in each state and summarizes the year’s
major gaming policy discussions in each jurisdiction.

Tables at the beginning of this report provide a comparative
summary of the main licensing, taxation, and responsible
gaming requirements applied to casino, sports betting and
iGaming operators, as well as to suppliers of electronic
gaming devices and table game equipment. This report
defines commercial casino locations as licensed land-
based casinos, riverboat casinos, and racetrack casinos
(racinos). It also includes casino locations in states such
as Delaware, New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island that

offer electronic gaming devices classified as video lottery
terminals and are operated by commercial casinos under
the authority of those states’ lotteries.

For the purposes of identifying commercial casino location
numbers, we do not include certain other types of gaming
locations, such as horse or dog racetracks without
electronic gaming devices, historical horse racing terminal
locations or off-track betting operations, lottery retail
locations, charitable gaming venues, tribal gaming facilities
as defined by the National Indian Gaming Commission,
card rooms or other locations at which gaming is incidental
to the primary business.

State gaming and tax revenue totals do not include revenue
and taxes from these non-commercial casino locations,
with the exception of Nevada. Due to its unique nature,
revenue and tax data from some Nevada locations which
offer “non-restricted” gaming as incidental to their primary
business is included.

Also excluded from state gaming revenue and tax totals is
revenue derived from convenience locations with electronic
gaming devices—such as video lottery terminals or video
gaming terminals—in lllinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and West Virginia.
The competitive impact of each of the above operations,
however, is noted where warranted.

State gaming revenue and tax totals do include iGaming
operations managed by commercial casinos or affiliated
companies in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Nevada,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

The totals also include all revenue from land-based and
online sports betting in each of the states with legal sports
betting, with the exception of sports betting revenue
earned by tribal gaming operators operating under a tribal-
state gaming compact in accordance with the 1988 Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act. State-specific sports betting totals
also include sports betting revenue derived from a handful
of non-casino locations, such as racetracks, off-track
betting outlets and standalone sportsbook locations, in
Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, lllinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. Due to reporting
restrictions, commercial casino gaming revenue does not
include revenue derived from parimutuel betting on horse
races at commercial casino race and sportsbooks, except
for such revenue derived at Nevada commercial casinos.

Sports betting handle and revenue information is reported
differently across states. Certain states, including Nevada,
use an accrual method of accounting that includes only
revenue from completed events. Others, including New
Jersey, utilize a cash method of accounting. Under this
accounting, bets made during 2023 on future events,
such as the 2024 Super Bowl or World Series winner, for
example, are included in 2023 revenue and future monthly
revenue reports would be adjusted to reflect the outcome
of those sporting events and whether operators paid

out winnings to customers. Readers should consult the
websites of state regulatory agencies for more information
on how each state accounts for sports betting revenue.

All references to “gaming revenue” are used as a
substitute for more specific financial terms—including
“casino win,” “adjusted gross receipts,” “gross gaming
revenue” and others—as reported by state regulatory
agencies. In general, total gaming revenue reflects the
“gross revenue” reported by casinos, iGaming operators
or sportsbooks prior to allowable deductions to account
for promotional spending or free-bet promotions extended
to players. Gaming regulatory agencies in each state
report monthly and annual revenue differently according
to varying regulated gaming products and readers should
consult those agencies’ websites for further information.

Importantly, gaming revenue does not equate to profits
earned by commercial casinos from their operations.

Such revenue is earned before properties pay for various
operating expenses, marketing, and employee salaries,

as well as various taxes and fees, among other things.
Similarly, gaming tax revenue figures listed in the report
reflect only specific gaming taxes paid by casinos, iGaming
platforms, and commercial sportsbook operations out of
monies won from patrons. They do not include various
other state, local, and federal taxes that apply to casinos
