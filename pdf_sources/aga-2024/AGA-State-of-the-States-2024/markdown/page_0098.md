Market Overview

Oklahoma offers commercial casino gaming at two racinos, which are regulated
by the Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission. The racinos may only operate
electronic gaming devices, with a maximum of 750 devices permitted at
Remington Park in Oklahoma City and 250 machines at Cherokee Casino Will
Rogers Downs in Claremore.

The racinos were first authorized in 2004, when Oklahoma voters also ratified
the State-Tribal Gaming Act, which established a regulatory framework for tribal
gaming in the state.

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record

for the vast majority of statewide commercial casino gaming revenue in 2023.
The racino facility reported electronic gaming device revenue of $129.2 million,
essentially in line with the equivalent total from the prior year.

Meanwhile, revenue from electronic gaming devices at Cherokee Casino Will
Rogers Downs, owned by the Cherokee Nation, was $22.2 million, an increase
of 2.8 percent from 2022.
