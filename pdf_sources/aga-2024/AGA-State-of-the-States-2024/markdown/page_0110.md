year that saw lawmakers pass significant amendments
to the state’s 2019 Sports Gaming Act.

Market Overview

Tennessee has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through
online sportsbook operators subject to regulation by the Tennessee Sports
Wagering Council.

A state law passed in 2019 authorizes commercial gaming operators to apply for
an unlimited number of licenses to offer online sports betting. Tennessee’s law
was notable for being the first in the U.S. to limit sports wagering exclusively to
online platforms, with no retail sportsbook operations permitted.

Legal sports betting began in November 2020. At the end of 2023, 12 online
sports betting platforms were available, unchanged from the previous year.

Market Performance

In 2023, total sports betting revenue in Tennessee reached an estimated
$459.3 million, up 20.8 percent from 2022’s reported total of $379.4 million.

Tennessee does not release revenue data, but a revenue figure for 2023 was
estimated by applying the average national hold percentage for online sports
betting, adjusted to account for the historical variance between Tennessee’s
historical hold percentage and the national average, to the monthly sports
wagering handle as reported by the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council. The
council ceased reporting monthly revenue statistics in mid-2023 following a
change in the state’s sports wagering tax structure.

Total handle for mobile sports betting in
2023 was $4.30 billion, an increase of
11.6 percent relative to 2022.
