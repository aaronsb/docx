Policy & Regulatory Review

Internet Gaming

Proponents of legalizing iGaming were disappointed in
2023 as legislation introduced in the Indiana House
of Representatives in January failed to pass out of
committee.

Supporters of expansion had been optimistic for iGaming
legislation in 2023 when the Indiana Gaming Commission

published an independent study on the issue in late 2022.

A similar study commissioned by the regulator on sports
wagering in 2018 preceded the successful passage of
legislation several months later.

Indiana lawmakers supportive of iGaming cited a lack

of appetite among their colleagues to revisit matters of
gaming expansion relatively soon after the 2019 law to
authorize sports betting and allow for the relocation of two
land-based casino properties in the state. Meanwhile, an
official fiscal note attached to the 2023 iGaming bill by
the Indiana General Assembly also suggested that some
portion of iGaming revenue would come at the expense of
traditional land-based casino gaming.

Mobile and land-based sports betting accounted for slightly
over 14 percent of Indianaâ€™s overall commercial casino
revenue total in 2023, compared with around 13 percent in
the previous year.
