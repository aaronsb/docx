based sports wagering.

Indiana offers commercial casino gaming at six riverboat casinos, four land-
based casinos and two racinos, each of which operates electronic gaming
devices, table games and sports betting. All 12 commercial casinos are
regulated by the Indiana Gaming Commission (IGC).

In 1993, the Indiana legislature approved the Riverboat Gambling Act, which
authorized the IGC to grant up to 10 casino licenses. Legislation authorizing an
11th commercial casino within a “historic hotel district” was approved in 2003,
paving the way for the opening of French Lick Resort Casino.

The state legislature in 2007 authorized the installation of up to 2,000
electronic gaming devices at each of Indiana’s two racetracks. Under legislation
passed in 2015 and later amended in 2019, racetracks were approved to also
install live-dealer table games.

In 2019, the legislature passed a bill authorizing sports betting at commercial
casinos and racinos, as well as at off-track betting facilities affiliated with
racinos. Casinos and racinos are also permitted to deploy online sports betting
through a maximum of three platforms operating under their licenses. At the
end of 2023, Indiana’s online sports betting market was served by 12 digital
sportsbook platforms, down from 14 at the start of the year.

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.82
billion, down 2.3 percent relative to the prior year. Partly reflecting expanded
