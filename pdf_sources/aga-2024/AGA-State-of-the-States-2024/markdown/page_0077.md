MONTANA

The Montana Lottery reported total sports betting
revenue of $8.5 million in 2023, an increase of

approximately 17.8 percent from the previous year.

Market Overview

Montana has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through
a network of sports wagering kiosks available at more than 520 host locations
across the state.

A May 2019 state law authorized the Montana Lottery to operate sports
wagering via electronic devices and mobile applications available on the
premises of approved retail locations that are already licensed to host limited-
stakes electronic gaming devices, charitable gaming or bingo. Sports betting is
regulated by the Montana Lottery Commission.

Market Performance

In 2023, total sports betting revenue generated by the Montana Lottery amounted
to $8.5 million, up 17.8 percent relative to the previous year. The total amount
wagered—or handle—was $62.3 million, up 22.3 percent compared with 2022.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Sports betting operated by the Montana Lottery is not subject to taxation

per se; instead, the lottery returns all net revenue after operating expenses,
including marketing and technology costs and retailer commissions to specific
programs as determined by the state legislature. As sports betting is operated
directly by the state, it is not subject to the 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to commercial operators’ wagering handle.

In 2023, sports betting generated
profits for the Montana Lottery of
approximately $3.8 million, up 36.7
