Colorado applies a graduated tax to electronic gaming
device and table game revenue, ranging from 0.25 percent
on revenue up to $2 million, to 20 percent on gaming
revenue of more than $13 million.

Sports betting revenue is taxed at a headline rate of 10
percent, applied after limited deductions of free bets and
other bonuses and promotions. Sportsbook operations
are further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax
applied to wagering handle. Federal excise payments are
also deductible from revenue subject to the state’s sports
betting tax.

In 2023, Colorado commercial casinos and their affiliated
online sports betting platforms generated approximately
$200.2 million in gaming tax revenue, up 6.7 percent
compared to the prior year.

All gaming tax revenues from electronic gaming devices
and table games, including license and application fees,
are placed in the Colorado Limited Gaming Fund. After
deducting around $17.5 million to cover state costs
associated with gaming oversight and regulation of
casinos, the remaining money is distributed according to
the following formula:

e 50 percent to the “state share,” which funds grant
programs that benefit higher education, tourism and
select industries in Colorado

e 28 percent to a fund dedicated to historic
preservation and restoration

e 12 percent to the two counties that host commercial
casinos

e 10 percent to the three historic cities that host
commercial casinos

Tax revenue generated by sports betting, meanwhile, is
placed in the state’s established Sports Betting Fund. In
2023, this amounted to approximately $27.4 million.

After deducting costs to cover the state’s regulation of
sports wagering, and then setting aside additional monies
for Colorado colleges, local governments hosting casinos
and gambling addiction services, the majority of remaining
sports betting tax revenue is distributed to a state water
preservation fund. Some sports betting tax revenue is

also dedicated to the same historic preservation fund that
receives a portion of gaming tax revenue generated by
traditional casino games.

Competitive Landscape

Colorado’s commercial casinos face limited competition
from two tribal casinos operated on Indian lands in the
southern part of the state.

The competitive environment for Colorado’s commercial
casinos is likely to remain stable in the near term, following
two successful statewide voter referendums in 2019 and
2020 to authorize sports betting and remove a maximum
bet limit that previously applied to table games.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Payments Modernization

In February, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control
Commission approved new regulations to allow for cashless
gaming via electronic gaming devices and table games at
commercial casinos.

Among other things, the rules require players to first
establish an account for cashless wagering and have
their identities verified before they are able to use funds
for gaming. Cashless gaming systems also must enable
players to set limits on the amount they wish to deposit in
a digital wallet or cashless gaming account.

The regulations for cashless gaming were subject to a
series of stakeholder workshops prior to their adoption and
became effective in April.

Fantasy Sports

In November, the Colorado Division of Gaming adopted
changes to state rules applied to fantasy sports contests
in order to require all contests to be determined on a
peer-to-peer basis among participants, while prohibiting
any fantasy contests in which a player competes directly
against the contest operator.
