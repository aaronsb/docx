KEY STATE INFORMATION

Market Overview

New Jersey offers commercial casino gaming at nine land-based casinos located
in Atlantic City. The casinos, which operate electronic gaming devices, table
games and sports betting, are regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Sports betting is
also available at state-licensed horse racetracks that do not offer other forms of
casino gaming.

New Jersey voters first approved casino gaming via a 1976 constitutional
amendment that restricted casinos to Atlantic City. The state’s first commercial
casino opened two years later.

Internet gaming was legalized in 2013, with online and land-based sports
betting following in 2018 after New Jersey successfully challenged a federal
ban on sports wagering before the U.S. Supreme Court. At the close of 2023,
a total of 30 internet casinos and 20 online sportsbooks were operational.
Compared to a year earlier, the number of internet casinos was unchanged but
online sportsbooks was down from 27.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue reached $5.78
billion, up 10.9 percent from 2022 and surpassing New Jersey’s previous
record high of $5.22 billion set in 2006.

At that time commercial casino gaming in New Jersey was limited to land-based
casino operations in Atlantic City, whereas 2023’s record total reflected the
