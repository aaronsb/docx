A Message from the American Gaming Association

May 2024
Dear Gaming Industry Colleague,

| am pleased to present State of the States 2024: The AGA
Survey of the Commercial Casino Industry, the American
Gaming Association’s (AGA) flagship research report on
U.S. commercial gaming in 2023.

Last year was another outstanding year for commercial
gaming, with record-breaking achievements that highlighted
our industry’s resilience and growth. Propelled by an
expanding U.S. gaming landscape, the commercial casino
sector enjoyed a third consecutive record year with gaming
revenue accelerating by 10.3 percent to nearly $66.7 billion.

When tribal gaming’s performance is factored in, the U.S.
gaming industry likely generated close to $110 billion in
gaming revenue in 2023, a remarkable 40 percent higher
than 2019.

Beyond the growing demand for our products, whether
in-person or online, our industry has never had a bigger
impact on the broader economic well-being of the
communities where we operate. New research conducted by
the AGA shows that gaming supports $329 billion in
economic activity, 1.8 million jobs, and $53 billion in annual
tax revenue each year. In terms of direct employment,
gaming is responsible for more jobs than the postal service
and film and video industries.

Our industry celebrated an important milestone in 2023—
the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court’s decision to
invalidate PASPA. By the end of the year, legal sports
betting availability had expanded to nearly 163 million
adults across 37 states and the District of Columbia,
generating more than $11 billion in gaming revenue.

While revenue growth and market expansion are always
important, the AGA’s focus extends far beyond the bottom
line. We remained focused in 2023 on earning and
keeping the trust of our guests, regulators and the public
as our industry ventures into new markets and introduces
itself to new audiences:

e The AGA strengthened its Responsible Marketing
Code for Sports Wagering and launched a new effort
to elevate responsible gambling and unify our
members and the broader industry to ensure our
approach keeps pace with dynamic industry change.

e We worked closely with regulators to crack down on
unregulated “skill” machines and sportsbook
operations in eight states.

e Here in Washington, D.C., we successfully advocated
for legislative measures directing the U.S. Department
of Justice to address all forms of illegal and
unregulated gambling. We also worked with the IRS
Advisory Council to advance our efforts to raise the
slot tax reporting threshold, a crucial step in
streamlining industry processes.

e Finally, the AGA continued to serve as the convener of
the worldwide gaming industry at Global Gaming
Expo. We brought G2E Asia to Macau and Singapore
while G2E Las Vegas saw 25,000 gaming
professionals gather to learn, network and advance
their businesses on the show floor, where exhibitors
showcased the latest innovations and technologies.

2023 marked my fifth year as AGA President and Chief
Executive Officer. Between COVID, the proliferation of
sports betting, the growth of iGaming, and a host of
technological changes, our industry — and the challenges
it faces — are dramatically different from when | started.
Whether it's on Capitol Hill, in a state house, or making the
case to local communities, | look forward to working with
you all again this year to meet these challenges head-on
and to continue to fight for an environment where legal
gaming can thrive.

With detailed information on the U.S. gaming market and
financial performance data for every commercial gaming
state, State of the States 2024 is the definitive guide to
the commercial casino industry. | extend my gratitude to
our report partners at Vixio Regulatory Intelligence for their
invaluable contributions.

I trust you will find State of the States 2024 to be an
indispensable resource, and | thank you for your ongoing
partnership and collaboration.

Bu

Sincerely,

William C. Miller, Jr.
President and CEO
American Gaming Association
