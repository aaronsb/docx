of American adults (49%) participated in some form of
gambling, either in-person or online.

Notably, survey results indicated that the increase in
casino visitation is being driven by a growing number
of younger adults who are spending their entertainment
dollars at casino properties: the average age of casino-
goers has decreased for four consecutive years—from
nearly 50 years in 2019 to 42 years in 2023.

Beyond the casino floor, Americans recognize gaming's
economic contributions, with 71 percent saying that

the industry has a positive impact on the U.S. economy.
Additionally, Americans cite job creation as the most
significant benefit to local economies from casino gaming:
73 percent of Americans ranking it among the top benefits,
followed by tourism attraction (61%) and casino taxes (57%).

Annual Internet Gaming Revenue -

A decade removed from the launch of legal iGaming in
New Jersey and Delaware in late 2013, iGaming continued
to report strong growth despite its limited footprint across
the country. Combined iGaming revenue in the six states
with legal online casinos reached a record $6.17 billion

in 2023, up 22.8 percent compared to the previous

year. New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania accounted
for more than 90 percent of the nationwide total, as the
two former states both recorded nearly identical annual
revenue of $1.92 billion and Pennsylvania regulators
reported annual iGaming revenue of $1.74 billion.

Rhode Island is poised to become the seventh state to
offer online casino gaming early in 2024, after lawmakers
enacted new legislation in June. iGaming legislation was
also considered in 2023, but not approved, in other states
including lllinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and New York.
