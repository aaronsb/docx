the state’s sportsbooks weathered new cross-border
competition from legal sports wagering in neighboring

Maine and Massachusetts.

Market Overview

New Hampshire has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting
through the New Hampshire Lottery and its contracted sportsbook partner.

A state law passed in July 2019 authorized the New Hampshire Lottery to offer
full sports betting through mobile platforms and at up to ten retail sportsbook
locations by partnering with a maximum of five private operators to conduct
sports wagering on its behalf. The lottery is also authorized to directly operate
sports lottery parlay games through its traditional network of retailers.

Through a request for proposals process, the New Hampshire Lottery selected
DraftKings to be its exclusive agent for mobile and retail sports wagering.
DraftKings’ New Hampshire mobile sportsbook was launched in December
2019. At the end of 2023, retail sports betting was also available at four land-
based sportsbook locations.

Market Performance

In 2023, total sports betting revenue in New Hampshire was $80.3 million, up
20.3 percent versus the previous year.

Total revenue from online sports betting was approximately $67.4 million, up
13.3 percent relative to 2022, while revenue from land-based sports betting
was $12.9 million, up 78.0 percent. The strong growth in land-based sports
betting revenue reflected, in part, the opening of a fourth retail sportsbook
location in September. Meanwhile, overall market growth came despite the
launch of legal sports wagering in
neighboring states Massachusetts and
Maine during the course of the year.
