A first full-year of legal sports betting in Kansas led to
record commercial casino gaming revenue of $588.3

KANSAS

million in 2023, up 23.0 percent versus the prior year.

Kansas offers commercial casino gaming at four state-owned casinos, which

are developed and managed by private companies. The casinos, each of which
offers electronic gaming devices, table games and sports betting, are operated
under the constitutional authority of the Kansas Lottery and are regulated by the
Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission (KRGC).

In 2007, the legislature approved the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, which
authorized the creation of four “lottery gaming facilities,” one in each of the
four designated gaming zones throughout the state. The four casinos opened
between 2009 and 2017.

In 2022, lawmakers approved legislation authorizing Kansas’ commercial
casinos to operate sports betting via land-based sportsbooks within their casino
properties, through kiosks installed at partnering retail locations, as well as
through a maximum of three branded mobile platforms for each casino. At the
end of 2023, Kansas'’s online sports betting market was served by six digital
platforms, unchanged from the previous year.

In 2023, statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $588.3 million, up
23.0 percent from the previous year.

The record total was mainly driven by a first full-year of revenue from Kansas'
legal sports betting market, which was launched in September 2022. Overall
sports betting revenue in 2023 was $182.4 million, more than double the
