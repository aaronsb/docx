COMMERCIAL CASINO GAMING CONSUMER SPEND BY STATE
2022 vs. 2023

All but four of the 36 jurisdictions with commercial casino or
sports betting operations in 2023 reported an increase in gaming
revenue compared with the prior year, with only the District of
Columbia, Florida, Indiana and Mississippi experiencing revenue
decline. All-time record annual commercial gaming revenue was
reported by 30 of the 36 jurisdictions.

The countryâ€™s largest commercial gaming market, Nevada, saw
annual revenue surpass $15 billion for the first time, while strong
growth in iGaming and sports betting revenue meant New Jersey
was also able to post a new record annual total for the first time
since 2006. 2023 brought one new state, Kentucky, into the fold
of commercial gaming states following the launch of regulated sports
betting operations governed by a new state law enacted in March.

COMMERCIAL CASINO DIRECT GAMING TAX REVENUE BY STATE
2022 vs. 2023

The strong growth in gaming revenue translated into a record
$14.67 billion in direct gaming tax revenue paid to state and
local governments by commercial gaming operations. The tax
total represented an increase of 9.7 percent from 2022. Notably,
the $14.67 billion figure reflects only specific state and local
taxes that are applied directly to gaming activities. It does not
include the billions more paid by the industry in the form of
income, sales, and various other corporate taxes, nor does the
total reflect payroll taxes paid by gaming operators and suppliers.
Also excluded are federal excise tax payments made by sports
betting operations.
