N E B R A S K A revenue of $89.1 million in 2023, the state’s first full

year of casino gaming operations.

Market Overview

Nebraska offers commercial casino gaming at three temporary racino facilities
that are authorized to offer electronic gaming devices, table games and sports
betting. Sports betting is also offered at a fourth racetrack location.

In 2020, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to allow commercial
casino gaming at licensed racetracks in Nebraska. State lawmakers approved a
bill in 2021 to implement the voter referendum, with that legislation recognizing
the prospect of sports betting being offered at racinos alongside traditional
electronic gaming device and table game operations. The state’s first racinos
commenced operations in 2022. Casino gaming is regulated by the Nebraska
Racing and Gaming Commission.
