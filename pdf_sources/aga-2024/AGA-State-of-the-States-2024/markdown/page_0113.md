2028 vs 2022

After opening in January, Rivers Casino Portsmouth reported
nearly $250 million in revenue in 2023, making it the most
lucrative of the state’s three commercial casino properties.
Notably, Rivers was the first of Virginia’s three casinos to
open as a permanent resort facility offering a full range

then redistributed to various beneficiaries. Between six and
eight percent of casino revenue is returned to the casino’s
host city, depending on the amount of revenue generated,
with 0.8 percent of revenue appropriated for problem
gambling treatment and support and a further 0.2 percent
distributed to a state fund that supports those suffering from
family violence and trauma. The remainder goes to Virginia's
General Fund and is used for state budgetary purposes as
determined by the state legislature.

The vast majority of sports betting tax revenue is
allocated to Virginia's General Fund, with 2.5 percent of
total revenue set aside for the state’s Problem Gambling
Treatment and Support Fund.

Competitive Landscape

Virginia's commercial casino market underwent a
significant expansion in 2023 as two new casino
properties were opened in the cities of Portsmouth, near
Norfolk, and Danville, located on the state’s southern
border with North Carolina.

While Rivers Casino Portsmouth opened as a permanent
casino-resort offering a full range of electronic gaming
devices and table games plus a sportsbook, both the
Caesars Virginia casino in Danville and Hard Rock
International’s Bristol Casino continued to operate as
temporary facilities pending construction of full-scale
resort properties. Permanent casinos are expected to open
in both Danville and Bristol at some point in 2024.

Under a 2020 state law, casinos are also authorized in the
cities of Norfolk and Richmond, although only the former
has received the requisite local approval by city voters.

In terms of sports betting, Virginia's online sportsbook
platforms compete for customers in the populous Greater
Washington D.C. region with online and land-based
sportsbooks operating in Maryland and the District of
Columbia. Bordering Kentucky and North Carolina both
approved laws to authorize mobile sports betting in 2023,
with operations already live in neighboring Tennessee and
West Virginia.

In addition to land-based casinos and sports betting,
Virginia's broader gaming market includes a racetrack
and affiliated off-track betting facilities that are eligible
to offer electronic gaming devices based on the outcome
of historical horse races. A larger historical horse racing
facility offering up to 1,800 electronic gaming devices

is under development in the city of Dumfries, some 30
miles south of Washington D.C., and is scheduled to open
in 2024. The Virginia Lottery also offers a range of online
lottery games.
