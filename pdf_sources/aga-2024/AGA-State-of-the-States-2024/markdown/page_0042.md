In 2023, Florida commercial casinos generated total tax
revenue of $241.8 million, down 0.4 percent from the
previous year.

Under Florida law, all tax revenue from commercial casinos
is deposited into Florida’s Educational Enhancement

Trust Fund (EETF). The fund was established in 1986

to allocate annual revenue from the then-newly created
Florida Lottery for Florida school districts, public colleges,
and universities. Additional sums are also used to provide
financial aid to Florida students. Each year, the Florida
Legislature determines which programs are funded and at
what level under the EETF.

Competitive Landscape

Florida’s commercial casinos face significant competition
from the state’s seven tribal casinos, six of which are
owned and operated by the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

In addition to electronic gaming devices, the Seminole
casinos are eligible to offer a full range of table games, as
well as both retail and mobile sports betting.

Card rooms at Florida racetracks and jai alai frontons
outside of Miami-Dade and Broward counties also offer
gaming but are limited to the operation of non-banked card
games, such as poker.

SOUTHERN STATES: YEAR-ON-YEAR CHANGE IN
COMMERCIAL CASINO REVENUE
2012 10 2023

The modest drop in commercial casino gaming revenue

in Florida in 2023 reversed the trend of previous years
that saw commercial casinos in Miami-Dade and Broward
counties report rising revenue but those in fellow southern
state Louisiana witnessing a decline.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Tribal Gaming

In a landmark June ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously reinstated
a groundbreaking tribal gaming compact that was signed
by the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the state of Florida
in 2021.

Among other provisions, the compact authorizes the
Seminole Tribe to offer mobile sports betting to players
throughout Florida via servers located on Indian lands.
The tribe was also permitted to offer craps, roulette, and
retail sports betting within its existing tribal casinos.

The three-judge appeals court panel overturned a lower
court ruling that had invalidated the compact on grounds
that the U.S. Secretary for the Interior violated the 1988
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by allowing the compact to
take effect.

In October, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to allow

the Court of Appeals ruling to take effect during further
legal appeals. The Seminole Tribe relaunched its mobile
sports betting platform in Florida in November and
then commenced retail sportsbook, craps and roulette
operations several weeks later.

Payments Modernization

Florida regulators took several steps in 2023 toward
allowing cashless gaming in the state’s commercial casino
gaming facilities.

In September, the Florida Gaming Control Commission
hosted a formal workshop with stakeholders to map

out specific regulations that would enable patrons at
commercial gaming facilities in Miami-Dade and Broward
counties to fund electronic gaming devices via digital
wallets. Formal regulatory changes are expected to be
adopted at some point in 2024.

Similar rules have been adopted in recent years in various
states, including Missouri, Nevada and South Dakota.
Colorado adopted regulations for cashless gaming earlier
in 2023.
