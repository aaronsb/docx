Rhode Island was the only state to legalize iGaming in

Sports Betting

A separate bill signed by Gov. McKee in June amended
Rhode Island’s sports betting law to allow for limited
wagering on in-state collegiate teams.

The legislation allows for betting on Rhode Island colleges
and universities only when those teams are taking part

in a tournament involving at least four teams. Previously
the law prohibited any wagering on a college sports event
either taking place in Rhode Island or involving a team
from the state. Betting on the actions or statistics of
individual college athletes remains prohibited.

The new legislation essentially alighed Rhode Island’s
approach to betting on college sports with that of
neighboring Massachusetts.
