ARKANSAS

$686.6 million, an increase of 11.8 percent from 2022
and including a first full year of revenue from mobile

sports betting operations.

Market Overview

Arkansas offers commercial casino gaming at two racinos and one land-based
casino, each of which operates electronic gaming devices, table games, and
both retail and mobile sports betting.

In 2018, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to allow casino
gaming at the state’s two racetracks, Oaklawn Park and Southland Park, as

well as at two new facilities located in Jefferson and Pope counties. Prior to the
constitutional amendment, gaming operations at the two tracks were restricted
to electronic gaming devices offering games of skill or games determined by the
outcome of historical horse races. Casino gaming and sports betting is regulated
by the Arkansas Racing Commission.

Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$686.6 million, up 11.8 percent versus the prior year.

Total statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices was $580.3 million, up
8.7 percent, while revenue from table games was $69.1 million, up 10.5 percent.

Total sports wagering revenue more than doubled to $37.2 million, reflecting a
first full year of mobile sports betting in Arkansas. After a staggered launch that
began in March 2022, the state’s three mobile sportsbooks generated $31.4
million in revenue during 2023 and accounted for 84.5 percent of the annual
sports betting total.
