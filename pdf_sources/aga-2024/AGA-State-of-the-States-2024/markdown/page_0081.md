revenue was $15.52 billion, up 4.6 percent from the
prior year. It was the third consecutive year that Nevada
reported all-time record annual gaming revenue.

After establishing the first modern regulatory system for casino gaming in

the late 1950s, Nevada developed a longstanding reputation as the premier
domestic and international gaming destination, welcoming millions of visitors to
its casino-resorts each year.

In 2001, Nevada became the first state to legalize iGaming before adopting
regulations ten years later limited to online poker games. Exempted from the
1992 congressional law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting
until 2018, Nevada is also the longest running market for legal sports wagering
in the United States.

The state’s commercial casinos are regulated by the Nevada Gaming Control
Board (NGCB) and Nevada Gaming Commission (NGC), with no restrictions on
the number of licenses available.

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was a record
$15.52 billion, up 4.6 percent compared to 2022. After suffering a sharp
revenue decline during the peak pandemic year of 2020, 2023 was the third
straight year of record-setting commercial gaming revenue in Nevada.

Total statewide gaming revenue from electronic gaming devices was $10.28
billion, up 2.8 percent versus the prior year, while revenue from table games
was $4.76 billion, up 8.4 percent. Sports betting revenue hit a record total of
