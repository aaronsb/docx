year, according to statistics collected by the Tennessee
Sports Wagering Council.

Of that amount, approximately $66.8 million was
distributed to the Tennessee Lottery’s education fund
used to support education programs across the state.
Some $12.5 million was allocated to local governments
for infrastructure projects, with the remainder set aside for
mental health and problem gambling services.

Competitive Landscape

Tennessee faces expanding regional competition from
sports betting operations in bordering states. Mobile sports
betting is available in neighboring Virginia, Arkansas and—
as of September 2023—Kentucky. North Carolina also
approved legislation for mobile sports wagering in 2023,
with operations expected to launch in 2024.

Retail sports betting is offered at one Arkansas
commercial casino and at several Mississippi casinos

in the Tunica/Lula market that attract patrons from the
Greater Memphis area. A sportsbook is also set to open in
2024 at Virginia's Hard Rock Bristol casino, located just
across the Tennessee border. The Bristol casino opened in
2022 as a temporary facility limited to electronic gaming
devices and table games.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In May, Gov. Bill Lee (R) signed a bill to make a series of
amendments to Tennessee’s 2019 sports wagering law.

One provision of the new legislation replaced Tennessee'’s
20 percent tax on sports betting revenue with a 1.85
percent tax applied on wagering handle. The legislation
also eliminated a statutory requirement for the state’s

mobile sportsbook operators to use official sports league
data to settle any in-play bets. Tennessee was the first
state in the nation to include an official league data
mandate in its sports betting law—a policy that has since
been followed by Arizona, Michigan, Virginia and several
other states.

Other statutory changes made by the 2023 legislation
included setting a tiered licensing fee structure for sports
betting operators based on their reported annual handle,
instead of a flat $750,000 annual fee for all operators.
The bill further introduced a new licensing structure for
sports wagering suppliers.

The Tennessee Sports Wagering Council—which was
also renamed from the Tennessee Sports Wagering
Advisory Council under the new law—approved revised
administrative regulations in September to conform with
the statutory changes. Those updated regulations took
effect in December.

Fantasy Sports

In April, Gov. Lee signed a separate bill to grant the
Tennessee Sports Wagering Council regulatory authority
over fantasy sports contests being offered in the state.

In 2016, Tennessee became one of the first states to

pass a specific law to license and regulate fantasy sports
contests—two years before the landmark U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that allowed states to do the same with sports
wagering.

Fantasy sports operators had previously been subject to
licensing by Tennessee’s Secretary of State before the
new legislation transferred authority to the specialist
sports betting agency. The Tennessee Sports Wagering
Council approved new regulations for fantasy contests in
September 2023, with those rules taking formal effect in
December.
