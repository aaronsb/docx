Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial gaming revenue was
$1.67 billion, up 47.3 percent from the prior year.

The record total chiefly reflected the addition of sports
betting to Massachusetts’ commercial casino gaming
market.

Sports betting revenue for the year was $483.2 million
from 11 months of land-based and ten months of online
sports wagering operations, with the latter accounting for
$473.6 million—or 98.0 percent—of the annual total.

Revenue from traditional casino games at the state’s
three casino properties was $1.18 billion in 2023, up
4.6 percent from the previous year. Total revenue from
electronic gaming devices was $789.9 million, up 5.9
percent, while table games revenue was $394.6 million,
up 2.2 percent.

Encore Boston Harbor accounted for 63.7 percent of total
land-based casino revenue. The property generated total
revenue of $754.8 million in 2023 and remained the third
most lucrative commercial casino-resort outside Nevada,
trailing only Resorts World New York City in Queens and
MGM National Harbor in Maryland.

Gaming Tax Distribution

When Massachusetts authorized commercial casino
gaming in 2011 it established different tax rates for its
Category 1 and Category 2 licensees.

Whereas Plainridge Park, which holds the Category 2
license, is subject to a 49 percent tax on electronic
gaming device revenue, MGM Springfield and Encore
Boston Harbor are subject to a lower rate of 25 percent
of both electronic gaming device and table game revenue.
The lower overall rate reflects, in part, the greater staff
cost involved in the hosting of live table games, as well
as the larger amounts Category 1 licensees were required
to invest to develop their casino-resorts. In addition to
the taxes on revenue, all commercial casino facilities
must pay a $600 annual fee for each of their electronic
gaming devices.

Revenue from land-based sports betting is taxed at a rate

of 15 percent, while mobile sports betting is taxed at 20
percent. Sportsbook operations are further subject to a 0.25
percent federal excise tax applied to wagering handle.

In 2023, Massachusetts’ commercial casinos and sports
betting operators generated total gaming tax revenue of
$427.4 million, up 34.7 percent from the prior year.

Of this amount, approximately $139.6 million was
distributed to Massachusetts’ Gaming Local Aid Fund,
which was created under the 2011 gaming law to help
support the budgetary needs of city and town governments
across the state. The fund receives the vast majority of tax
revenue by Massachusetts’ Category 2 casino and is the
single biggest beneficiary of taxes raised from electronic
gaming devices and table games at the state’s two casino-
resort properties. The Local Aid Fund also receives 27.5
percent of total sports wagering tax revenue.

Other major beneficiaries of commercial casino gaming
tax revenue in Massachusetts include a transportation
infrastructure fund, a state education fund, a public health
trust fund and the state’s horse racing industry.

Competitive Landscape

Massachusetts’ three commercial casinos operate in a
fiercely competitive New England gaming market that
also includes several large-scale commercial and tribal
casinos in neighboring Connecticut and Rhode Island that
have traditionally drawn a significant proportion of their
customers from the Bay State.

Additional in-state competition is also pending in the shape
of the Mashpee Wampanoag'’s potential tribal casino-resort
