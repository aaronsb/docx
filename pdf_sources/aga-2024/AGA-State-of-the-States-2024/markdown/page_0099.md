Gaming Tax Distribution

Oklahoma taxes commercial casino revenue at different
rates based on the amount of revenue generated. Rates
range in a graduated scale from 35 percent on revenue
up to $10 million, to 50 percent on revenue of more than
$70 million.

In 2023, Oklahoma racinos paid approximately $68.9
million in total gaming taxes, an increase of 0.3 percent
relative to the previous year.

Commercial gaming tax revenue is shared between the
state government and Oklahoma'’s horse racing industry.
Approximately $31.5 million was remitted to the state in
2022 and used to fund state education initiatives, as well
as for general budgetary purposes.

Racinos also distributed roughly $36.6 million to help
subsidize horse racing purses, breeding programs and
other horse racing industry expenses.

Competitive Landscape

Oklahoma’s two racinos are overshadowed by the state’s
139 tribal casinos, which are authorized to offer table
games, in addition to electronic gaming devices. During
the state’s 2023 fiscal year ending June 30, Oklahoma
tribal casinos generated an estimated $3.34 billion in
casino gaming revenue, a 4.7 percent increase from the

While Oklahoma’s two commercial racinos have reported a
modest increase in revenue since the height of the COVID-19
pandemic in 2020, the state’s far larger tribal gaming
sector has since seen its annual revenue soar to $3.34
billion in fiscal year 2023.

previous year. This figure is exclusive of revenue from

While Oklahoma borders no less than five states that
offer commercial casino gaming, the primary competitive
threat to the state’s gaming market comes from potential
legalization in Texas. In 2023, lawmakers in Texas

again considered legislation to authorize casinos, but a
constitutional resolution to enable commercial casino
gaming failed to pass by the required majority in the
state’s House of Representatives.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Tribal Gaming

Legal and legislative wrangling over the status of tribal
gaming compacts in Oklahoma continued in 2023.

In October, a state legislative committee rejected the
request of Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) to validate new tribal gaming
compacts that he signed with two of Oklahoma’s Native
American tribes in 2020. Those compacts were allowed

to take effect by the U.S. Department of Interior but later
blocked by the state Supreme Court, which ruled that they
impermissibly included additional forms of commercial
gaming—specifically sports betting—that had not yet
been approved by the Oklahoma legislature. Litigation over
the same issue remained pending before federal courts as
of the end of 2023.

Gov. Stitt, a second-term governor who was re-elected
in 2022, has called for tribes to pay the state a higher
share of their casino gaming revenue and previously
unsuccessfully argued that Oklahoma'’s original tribal
gaming compacts from 2004 expired at the end of their
first 15-year term.

Sports Betting

In November, Gov. Stitt announced a legislative proposal
to authorize sports betting in Oklahoma.

Stitt’s plan would authorize retail sports wagering
exclusively at Oklahoma tribal casinos pursuant to tribal
gaming compacts, while also enabling the state to
issue additional licenses for mobile sports betting to be
conducted as a form of commercial casino gaming.

Legislation reflecting the governor’s proposal was not
formally considered in 2023 and Native American tribes
swiftly voiced opposition to the plan, which they said they
were not consulted on.

In March, a separate bill to authorize sports wagering
exclusively via tribal gaming compacts was approved by
the Oklahoma House of Representatives. The bill was not
