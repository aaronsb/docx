prior year total of $76.5 million. Mobile sports betting
accounted for $177.5 million—or 97.3 percent—of the
statewide sports wagering revenue total.

four commercial casino properties was $355.8 million

Gaming Tax Distribution

pay a minimum tax rate of 27 percent on revenue from
electronic gaming devices and table games, which includes
a minimum 22 percent payment to the state, 3 percent

to local governments, and 2 percent to fund problem
gambling treatment. Casinos’ management contracts

also include provisions allowing for higher tax rates to be
applied if revenue exceeds a certain threshold during a
calendar year.

Revenue from land-based and online sports betting is
taxed at a rate of 10 percent. Sports betting operations are
further subject to a 0.25 percent federal excise tax applied
to wagering handle.

In 2023, Kansas’' commercial casino gaming industry
generated total tax revenue of approximately $128.9
million, an increase of 16.6 percent from the prior year.

Of this amount, approximately $96.8 million was
distributed to the state’s Expanded Lottery Act Revenue
Fund. Appropriations from the fund are determined
annually at the direction of the state legislature but must
be allocated to specific causes that include state debt
reduction, covering public employees’ retirement liabilities,
and an initiative to increase the number of engineering
graduates at Kansas universities. A further $13.2 million
was allocated in 2023 to local governments that host
casinos, while $8.8 million was generated to fund problem
gambling services.

The annual tax total also included approximately $10.0
million that was raised from taxes applied to sports
betting. Under Kansas’ 2022 sports wagering law, all
sports betting tax revenue collected by the state is
redistributed for specific purposes that include prosecuting
illegal gambling, funding problem gambling initiatives

and incentivizing professional sports teams to relocate to
Kansas.

Competitive Landscape

In addition to its four commercial casinos, Kansas hosts
seven tribal casinos on Indian reservation lands within the
state. Tribal casinos located in the northeastern corner

of the state compete with Hollywood Casino at Kansas
Speedway located just outside of Kansas City. Hollywood
Casino also competes directly with four casinos on the
Missouri side of the Kansas—Missouri border.

Kansas Crossing Casino in southeastern Kansas competes
with several tribal casinos in northeastern Oklahoma.
Kansas Star Casino, the state’s largest commercial casino,
competes directly with a tribal casino in Sedgwick County,
near Wichita, which opened in 2021.

Under provisions that were included in Kansas’ 2022
sports wagering law, Kansas Star Casino also faces
forthcoming competition from electronic gaming devices
based on the outcome of historical horse races that may
be operated at the site of a former greyhound track in
Sedgwick County.

Greyhound Park racetrack.

electronic gaming devices based on the outcome of
historical horse races exclusively at a single site in
