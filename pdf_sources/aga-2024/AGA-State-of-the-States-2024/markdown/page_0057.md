In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming

revenue was $2.70 billion, up 4.0 percent versus the

LOUISIANA

previous year, as growth in sports betting revenue offset
a decline in revenue from traditional casino games
offered by the state’s casinos and racinos.

Louisiana offers commercial casino gaming at 12 riverboat casinos and three
land-based casinos, each of which may operate electronic gaming devices, table
games and sports betting. Four racinos—Iimited to offering electronic gaming
devices and sports betting—are also operational. All 19 properties are regulated
by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (LGCB).

Commercial casino gaming was first authorized by a 1991 law allowing a
maximum of 15 riverboat casinos, either sailing or permanently moored on
specific waterways in different areas of the state. The following year, legislation
passed authorizing a single land-based casino in downtown New Orleans.
Racinos were approved by the legislature in 1997 and a 2018 law authorized
riverboat casinos to apply for regulatory approval to move to land-based facilities
located adjacent to their existing dock site.

In 2020, voters in 55 of 64 Louisiana parishes approved a referendum on
sports betting. Legislation to implement that referendum was then passed

in 2021. Land-based sports betting was launched in Louisiana commercial
casinos and racinos in October 2021, with online sportsbook operations
commencing in January 2022. At the end of 2023, sports betting was available
via 18 land-based sportsbook locations as well as via nine affiliated online
platforms, up from eight online platforms a year earlier.

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming revenue was $2.70 billion,
up 4.0 percent versus the previous year, as growth in sports betting revenue
offset a decline in traditional casino games.
