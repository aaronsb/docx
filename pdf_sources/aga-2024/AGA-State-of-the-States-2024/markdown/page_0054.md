Sedgwick County. The KHRC awarded the license to the
owner of the former greyhound track after adopting a
selection policy which served to disqualify a competing
application submitted by the owner of the nearby Kansas
Star Casino. In February, a state judge dismissed a lawsuit
filed by the owner of Kansas Star Casino claiming that the
authorization of the historical horse racing in Sedgwick
County violated the terms of its management contract for
the casino.

Tribal Gaming

In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
upheld a lower federal court ruling that enabled the
Wyandotte Nation to open a tribal casino on a parcel of
land roughly 10 miles north of Wichita.

The state of Kansas had claimed the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior erred in its 2020 decision to approve the
tribe’s application to take the land into trust and develop a
casino. However, the appeals court panel agreed that the
Secretary was required to approve the application based
on exemptions for tribal gaming outlined in 1988’s Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act.

The Wyandotte Nation opened its CrossWinds Casino as
a temporary facility in 2021 but has said it intends to
develop a larger casino-resort pending the resolution of
legal challenges.

Sports Betting

In April, Gov. Laura Kelly (D) signed a bill to amend a
provision of Kansas’' 2022 sports betting law that had
previously prevented federally recognized Indian tribes
from including statewide mobile sports wagering in their
tribal gaming compacts with the state.

In the wake of the statutory change, the state legislature
passed a resolution approving an amendment to the
compact between Kansas and the Prairie Band Potawatomi
Nation to enable the tribe to offer a sportsbook within its
established casino, as well as launch a mobile betting
platform available across Kansas operating via servers on
tribal lands.

The U.S. Department of Interior allowed the compact
amendment to take effect in July.

Similar provisions to those of the Prairie Band Potawatomi
Nation compact amendment were also included within the
landmark 2021 tribal gaming compact agreed between
Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida that was upheld
by a federal appeals court in 2023.
