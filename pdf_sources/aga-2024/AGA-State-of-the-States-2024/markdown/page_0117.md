Policy & Regulatory Review
Internet Gaming

In November, the West Virginia Lottery Commission
announced that it had joined Delaware, Nevada, New
Jersey and Michigan as a signatory of the Multi-State
Internet Gaming Agreement, enabling online poker players
in West Virginia to compete against those in the other four
member states subject to regulatory approval.

As of the end of 2023, none of West Virginia’s eight online
casinos were offering peer-to-peer poker games to players
located within the state—Iargely because of the state’s
relatively small population and the challenges that creates
in establishing sufficient liquidity for poker games to be
attractive.

In theory, multistate poker play offers a more appealing
experience for players as operators can offer a broader
range of games and tournaments, with larger prize pools.

Regulatory Reform

In March, Gov. Jim Justice (R) signed a bill designed to
incentivize operators of West Virginia’s racinos to upgrade
their electronic gaming devices and associated software by
lowering annual permit fees that are levied on each device.

The legislation specifically enables commercial gaming
operators to pay an annual fee of $500 instead of $1,000
for any electronic gaming device that outperforms the
bottom 10 percent of devices in the state by more than
$500 in terms of annual revenue.
