Market Performance

In 2023, total statewide commercial casino gaming
revenue reached $2.50 billion, up 13.5 percent versus the
prior year.

The figure was a record annual revenue total and reflected
a first full year of mobile sports betting in Maryland.

Annual sports betting revenue amounted to $514.1 million
in 2023, more than triple 2022’s total of $149.5 million
that included less than two months of revenue from mobile
wagering. Mobile sports betting accounted for $497.7
million—or 96.8 percent—of the 2023 total. Revenue
from land-based sports betting was $16.4 million, down
sharply from $41.3 million in 2022.

Statewide revenue from electronic gaming devices at

commercial casinos was $1.33 billion in 2023, up 0.5
percent relative to the previous year. However, revenue
from table games fell 10.4 percent to $648.0 million.

Declining revenue from table games and retail sports
betting meant MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s
County lost its status as the most lucrative commercial
casino-resort outside of Nevada by gaming revenue. The
property, located just outside of Washington D.C., reported
a 6.6 percent decline in gaming revenue in 2023 and was
surpassed by Resorts World New York City in Queens.

Competitive Landscape

Maryland’s six commercial casinos operate in a competitive
Mid-Atlantic region that includes properties in Delaware,
eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The state’s three
largest casinos—MGM National Harbor, Live! Casino

and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore—also compete with
Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, West Virginia, for
customers in the populous Baltimore—Washington D.C.
metro area.

In terms of sports betting, retail sportsbooks at the MGM,
Live! and Horseshoe casinos, as well as those at FedEx
Field in Landover and at a sports bar in North Bethesda,
compete with five retail sportsbook facilities at Washington
D.C.’s three major sports stadiums and other locations. In
addition, Maryland’s mobile sports betting platforms face
a degree of cross-border competition for customers in the
Greater Washington D.C. area from mobile sportsbooks
licensed to operate in Virginia, as well as from the D.C.
Lottery’s mobile platform.
