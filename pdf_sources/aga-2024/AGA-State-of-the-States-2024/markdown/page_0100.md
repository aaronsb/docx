The Oregon Lottery reported a 53.1 percent increase

in total sports betting revenue to $64.3 million, the first
full-year of DraftKings operating the state’s lone online

OREGON

sportsbook platform.

Market Overview

Oregon has no commercial casino venues but offers sports betting through the
Oregon Lottery and its contracted partner.

A limited form of sports betting was first launched by the Oregon Lottery in 1989,
granting the state a partial exemption from the 1992 federal law that prohibited
expanded sports wagering. Although sports betting ended in 2007, the Oregon
Lottery revived the offering in 2019 and expanded it to include single-event
wagering on all professional sports. The Oregon Lottery’s own sportsbook product
was discontinued in January 2022 after the lottery executed a contract with
DraftKings to instead market and operate sports wagering on its behalf.

There is no specific state law that regulates sports betting in Oregon; instead, it is
considered to fall under the broader definition of lottery games the state lottery is
authorized to offer.

Market Performance

In 2023, total commercial sports betting revenue in Oregon was $64.3 million,
up 53.1 percent from the previous year, as reported by the Oregon State Lottery
Commission.

As the Oregon Lottery has yet to launch any form of retail sports wagering, the
entirety of commercial gaming revenue generated in 2023 was derived from
DraftKings’ online sports betting platform.

Notably, due to state policy, the Oregon Lottery and DraftKings remain unable to offer
wagers on any collegiate sports. Although New Jersey and several other states prohibit
wagers on games involving in-state college
teams, DraftKings' Oregon sportsbook is the
only online sports betting platform unable to
offer bets on any college sports.

Gaming Tax Distribution

Sports betting operated by the Oregon
Lottery is not subject to taxation per

se; instead, the lottery receives an
undisclosed percentage of revenue earned
by DraftKings following the deduction of
certain authorized expenses, including
marketing costs. As sports betting is
operated via the state lottery, it is not
subject to the 0.25 percent federal
excise tax typically applied to commercial
operators’ wagering handle.

GGR (US$M)

In 2023, sports betting generated
estimated state tax revenue of
approximately $30.1million, up 54.1
percent from the prior year.
