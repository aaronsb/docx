and Gaming—also compete directly with sportsbooks at
nearby commercial casinos located in Evansville, Indiana
and Cincinnati, Ohio, respectively.

In addition to offering betting on sports and horse racing,
Kentucky's licensed racing facilities may also offer
electronic gaming devices determined by the outcome

of historical horse races. In 2023, so-called historical
horse racing devices generated total gaming revenue of
approximately $808.7 million, according to statistics
gathered by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.

Policy & Regulatory Review

Sports Betting

In March, Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed a bill to authorize
land-based and mobile sports betting in Kentucky.

With no established casino gaming industry in Kentucky,
the law approved by the state legislature authorized sports
betting exclusively through Kentucky’s licensed horse
racetracks, with track owners eligible to deploy up to
three mobile sports betting platforms under their sports
wagering licenses.

Regulations to implement the new law were promulgated
by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission in July, at the
same time as Gov. Beshear announced the formation of a

seven-member sports wagering advisory council to guide the
racing commission through the implementation process.

Kentucky became the 37th state to launch legal sports
betting in early September when retail sports betting
began at racetracks and affiliated racing locations. Mobile
sports betting was launched three weeks later.

Illegal Gaming

Gov. Beshear signed a separate bill in March to outlaw
so-called “skill games,” unregulated electronic gaming
devices that had proliferated in Kentucky bars and other
establishments over recent years.

The bill specifically extended the definition of an illegal
gambling device under state law to incorporate devices
based on any element of chance, regardless of whether
the outcome of the game was also partially based on skill.
The legislation, which was supported by Kentucky’s racing
industry but opposed by providers of the unregulated
devices, also established new civil penalties for any person
who conducts, manages or owns a gambling device in
violation of state law.

Within weeks of the law passing, a lawsuit was filed to
challenge the prohibition on state constitutional grounds.
As of the end of 2023, that litigation remained pending
before state courts.
