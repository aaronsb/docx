State By State iGaming Regulations, Taxes & Fees

At the close of 2023, iGaming was regulated and legally available in a total of seven states. Six states—Connecticut,
Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia—allow for a full range of online casino games to be played
online, whereas Nevada permits strictly online poker games. Rhode Island passed a law to legalize iGaming in 2023. As
with land-based casino gaming and sports betting, the seven states with legal iGaming have vastly different legal and
regulatory requirements, including on taxation as well as the licensing of iGaming operators and any affiliated branded
platforms—or “skins”—that may be able to contract with an operator to participate in the market under their license.
