horse races, as well as sports wagering. Elsewhere, three
West Virginia racinos and one Pennsylvania racino are also
located near Ohio’s eastern border and draw customers
from the state. In October 2023, a new Kentucky historical
horse racing facility opened just a few miles from Ohio’s
southern border.

Thanks to legislation passed by the Kentucky General
Assembly in 2023, land-based and online sports betting is
also available in each of the five states that border Ohio.

Policy & Regulatory Review
Sports Betting

In June, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed a state budget that
made several amendments to Ohio’s 2021 sports betting
laws.

The most notable change doubled the tax rate applicable
to sports betting revenue from 10 percent to 20 percent,
effective July 1, 2023. Gov. DeWine had proposed the tax
increase as part of his executive budget proposal released
in January, citing concerns over the prevalence of sports
betting advertising within the first few weeks since the
market’s launch.

Another provision of the budget law provided the Ohio
Casino Control Commission with statutory authority to
involuntarily exclude individuals from participating in
sports wagering if they publicly threaten harm to athletes
involved in sporting events. The amendment was the result
of concerns expressed by Ohio college athletic directors
over inappropriate comments by sports bettors on social
media directed toward student athletes.

Expansion

A further provision of Ohio’s budget law signed in June
established a new 11-member commission to study the
future of the state’s gaming, lottery and racing industries.

The commission, to be made up of state legislators

and representatives of Ohio’s regulatory bodies, was
specifically mandated to evaluate the implementation of
sports betting as well as the status of commercial casino
gaming in the state and submit policy recommendations
regarding both sectors for consideration by the Ohio
General Assembly. Those recommendations are due to be
submitted by June 30, 2024.
